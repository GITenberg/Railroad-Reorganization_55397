<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">It</span> sometimes happens that experiences long since past seem to
be repeated, and that knowledge apparently forgotten proves
again of service. This is illustrated by the subject of railroad
reorganization. In the years between 1893 and 1899 an imposing group
of American railroads passed into receivers’ hands. In 1893 alone
more than 27,000 miles, with an aggregate capitalization of almost
$2,000,000,000, were taken over by the courts, and in the following
years the amount was largely increased. Foreclosure sales aggregated
10,446 miles in 1895, 12,355 in 1896, and 40,503 between 1894 and
1898. Among the more important failures were those of the Richmond &amp;
West Point Terminal, the Reading, the Erie, the Northern Pacific, the
Atchison, and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio;—to say nothing of the Norfolk
&amp; Western, the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago, the Ann Arbor, the
Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern, the Pecos Valley, and many other
smaller lines.</p>

<p>The railroads which failed between 1893 and 1898 were subsequently
reorganized. In order to restore the equilibrium between income and
outgo the companies turned to their creditors, and demanded the
surrender of a part of the rights of which bondholders were then
possessed. This demand the creditors were forced to concede. Some
of them yielded without legal compulsion, assenting to “voluntary
reorganizations”; some insisted upon the sale of the property
securing their loans, but without escaping the loss which fell upon
their more pliant associates. Much injustice to individuals came
to light at this time. Men who had invested in good faith were
obliged to sacrifice their holdings through no fault of their own.
The savings of years were swept away. The demand of the railroads
was one, nevertheless, which the courts supported, and rightly. The
companies could not be operated unless the creditors were deprived of
part of their legal rights. At the same time, these rights no longer
had a material basis on which to rest, and their surrender meant but
the recognition of a loss which had already taken place.</p>

<p>Most of the reorganizations were completed by the year 1899. Since
that date the improvement in railroad earnings has been marvellous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Gross earnings from operation were $1,300,000,000 in 1899, they
were $2,300,000,000 in 1906, the last year for which the figures of
the Interstate Commerce Commission are at present available. Total
income, after the deduction of operating expenses, was $605,000,000
in 1899, and $1,046,000,000 in 1906. It is not to be wondered at
that the distress of the years 1893–9 has not been duplicated during
the years 1900–7. On the contrary, weak roads have had opportunity
to strengthen their positions, and strong ones have spent enormous
sums for improvements, and have declared liberal dividends besides.
In no year save 1905 has the new mileage put into receivers’ hands
been greater than 800 miles, and in but one has the mileage sold at
foreclosure equalled that figure. Operating expenses have increased
because the amount of business has exceeded the ability of the
railroads to handle it. Equipment has been so inadequate as to
provoke drastic legislation by the legislatures of many states; yards
and terminals have been crowded until a prominent railroad officer
has declared the expenditure of over five billion dollars to be
necessary to restore the equilibrium between facilities and traffic.</p>

<p>These conditions have caused the earlier problems of failure and
reorganization to be lost to view. Nevertheless, the financial panic
of October, 1907, and the recession in activity which has become more
and more apparent since that time, have again brought these problems
forward. The Seaboard Air Line, one of the important railroad
systems of the South, failed on January 5, 1908. The Chicago Great
Western followed three days later. The Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton,
the Chicago, Cincinnati &amp; Louisville, the International &amp; Great
Northern, the Western Maryland, and the Macon &amp; Birmingham have since
been put in receivers’ hands. In all, the operation of 5938 miles of
railroad, with a capitalization of nearly $415,000,000, and total
liabilities of $462,000,000, has been taken over by the courts during
the first ten weeks of 1908. Whether this is but the beginning of
still more extended trouble it is of course impossible to say. There
are a number of weak lines in the American railroad system, and the
difficulty in obtaining credit is bound to reveal weaknesses where
they exist. At present new loans have for some months been difficult
to obtain, and even strong railroads have resorted to the issue of
short time notes. The Erie, indeed, escaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">vii</a></span> bankruptcy on April
8, 1908, only through the timely aid of important bankers who took
up its maturing notes. This points to serious consequences for the
weaker lines. It is true, on the other hand, that American railroads
are generally in better financial and physical condition than they
were in 1893. It is not probable that any railroad collapse will
be so widespread now as it was then. Whether this be so or not,
the failure of nearly 6000 miles of railroad in ten weeks invests
reorganization problems at present with an importance which they have
not had for ten years. How, it will be asked, shall the financial
operations necessary to reorganization be performed? What methods
shall be adopted, what dangers avoided, and what results expected?</p>

<p>The experience of earlier years will provide answers to many of the
questions asked in 1908. In the hope, therefore, that a study of
railroad reorganization, on which the author has been intermittently
engaged during the last six years, will prove of service, the
following pages have been published. They discuss in some detail
the financial history of the seven most important railroads which
failed from 1892–6, and that of one railroad, the Rock Island,
which was reorganized in 1902; and summarize in a final chapter the
characteristics of the various reorganizations in which these roads
have become involved. In some respects the history of each road
considered is peculiar unto itself. The Reading had coal to sell,
the Atchison did not. The Southern ran through a sparsely settled
country, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio through a thickly settled one. The
Erie has never recovered from the campaigns of Gould, Drew, and Fisk
from 1864–72, the Northern Pacific was not opened until 1883. In
other respects, however, the roads have had much in common. Excepting
only the Rock Island, each of them has found itself at one time or
another unable to pay its debts, and has had to seek measures of
relief. The problems of the different companies at these times have
been strikingly alike. However caused, their financial difficulties
have been expressed in high fixed charges, and, usually, in excessive
floating debts. Greater annual obligations have been assumed than
the roads could meet, and current liabilities have accumulated while
pressing demands have been satisfied. To this state of affairs the
remedy has been sought in comprehensive exchanges of old securities
for new. The exchanges, it is true, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span> been carried out in
different ways, and the collateral expedients employed have not been
the same. To similar problems different solutions have been applied.
It is possible, for this very reason, for a careful study of the
alternative reorganization methods which have been developed to point
out some policies which have been dangerous, and to make clear others
which are both just, and likely to be successful. Such a study also
throws light upon the history of the companies upon which it is based.</p>

<p>For the way in which the different roads have been handled, the
reader is referred to the text. The order of treatment is very
roughly determined by geographical location; that is, the Eastern
roads are first considered, then the Southern, and then the Western.
Each chapter, except the last, should be examined as a “case” in
reorganization experience, and as part, therefore, of a united whole.
No one has been so continuously with his work as the author himself,
and no one can more keenly realize its defects. It is offered as a
contribution in a field in which very little has as yet been done,
and it is hoped that it will prove of value to those concerned
with reorganization plans, as well as to those interested in the
development of corporation finance during the last generation.</p>

<p>Without the unselfish and intelligent assistance of the writer’s
Mother, the preparation of this book would have been long delayed.
To her, first of all, thanks are due. To Professor William Z.
Ripley, of Harvard University, should be made warm acknowledgment
of his constant interest and helpful suggestions. To the Carnegie
Institution the author is indebted for grants in aid of research
in this special field. Grateful acknowledgment should also be made
of gifts by friends of the University to cover the expenses of
publication.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad was the first important railway company
to be incorporated in the United States. It was designed to aid the
city of Baltimore in securing the Western trade, and not only private
citizens but the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland early
subscribed to its stock. When in the course of construction it became
expedient to extend into Virginia, the city of Wheeling and the state
of Virginia likewise subscribed, though the action of the latter was
subsequently withdrawn.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> As a result the funds required for first
construction were obtained from the sale of stocks instead of bonds.
In 1844, seventeen years after the granting of the charter, the
annual report showed $7,000,000 in stock as against $985,000 in 6 per
cent bonds; while in 1849, though the loans had been increased, they
yet stood in the proportion of one to two.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>On December 1, 1831, the first train was run over the line, then
72½ miles in length.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The early history of the road does not much
concern us. It was one of steady growth, not through an unsettled
territory, as with our Western roads, but through a country the
industries of which were already established. Tracks led, not into
prairies, but to populous cities; and the future of the company, once
the initial difficulties should have been overcome, was at no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span> time
uncertain. Thus extension to Cumberland increased the gross receipts
from $426,492 to $575,235, and that to Wheeling in 1853 likewise
brought a great increase in traffic.</p>

<p>The Civil War bore upon the Baltimore &amp; Ohio heavily because of the
peculiar location of its mileage. On May 28, 1861, possession was
taken by the Confederates of more than one hundred miles of the
main stem, embracing chiefly the region between the Point of Rocks
and Cumberland.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Government protection was temporarily restored
in 1862, but raids occurred until the end of the war. Each time
the Confederates occupied the line they tore it up, and as soon as
they retired the company hastened to make repairs. The road did not
default. A portion of the track yielded a revenue from first to last,
and presumably the Government paid generously for the transportation
of its troops.</p>

<p>It was after the Civil War that the real history of the road began.
The key-note was competition;—competition of the fiercest sort
between parallel lines from Chicago to the seaboard, intensified
by the rivalry of the great seaboard cities, and involving traffic
in both directions. The decade 1850–60 had seen the extension of
Eastern roads to Western connections. In 1851 the Erie had reached
Lake Erie; in 1853 the New York Central and Lake Shore, and in 1855
the Pennsylvania and Fort Wayne had opened continuous routes from
the Atlantic to Chicago. In 1857 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio had obtained
connection with Cincinnati and St. Louis; and in 1858 the Grand Trunk
had arrived at Sarnia on its way from Portland to Chicago. After the
Civil War there was both consolidation and extension. The New York
Central was united with the Hudson River, and the Pennsylvania leased
the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne &amp; Chicago in 1869. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio
reached Chicago in 1874, and the lines which in April, 1880, were
consolidated into the Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk were completed between
Port Huron and Chicago in February of that year. The completion of
these through routes opened the way for very bitter competition. Five
independent lines struggled for Chicago business, and all of them
were prepared to cut rates deeply in order to test their rivals’
strength. In particular the Baltimore &amp; Ohio was aggressive. “At the
time of its [Chicago branch] opening,” said Mr. Blanchard before the
Hepburn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span> Committee, “it was heralded all over the Northwest as a
‘Relief for the Farmer,’ ‘the Grangers’ Friend,’ and all other sorts
of headlines were put into the Chicago and Northwestern papers; and
President Garrett’s public utterances, and those to his Board, were
filled with enough statements to show what he intended to do.... I
heard him [say] that upon the completion of his lines, like another
Samson, he could pull down the temple of rates upon the heads of
these other trunk lines.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Under these circumstances a dispute between the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and
the Pennsylvania in 1874 over the former’s connection with New York
had far-reaching consequences.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The Pennsylvania refused to carry
Baltimore &amp; Ohio cars over its line north from Philadelphia, and as a
retaliatory measure the Baltimore &amp; Ohio reduced passenger fares from
Washington and Baltimore to Western points from 25 to 40 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
The reduction in rates thus begun inaugurated the first of the great
railroad wars. The cuts soon extended to east-bound passengers and
to freight, and forced corresponding cuts on the Pennsylvania, the
Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern, the Michigan Central, the New York
Central, and the Erie. Rates on fourth class and grain from Chicago
to New York, which had been 60 cents per 100 pounds in December,
1873, and 40 cents in December, 1874, fell to 30 cents in March,
1875. Rates on special, or sixth class,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> went as low as 12 cents
from Baltimore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span> and Philadelphia to Chicago. Passenger fares from
Chicago to Baltimore and Washington were reduced from $19 to $9, to
Philadelphia from $19 to $12, to New York from $22 to $15, and to
Boston from $22 to $15. The New York Central and the Erie quoted
fares from New York to Chicago of $18 and to St. Louis of $20, and
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio replied by a cut to $16.25 to Chicago. In
April, 1875, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio cut freight rates from Cumberland
to Baltimore over 50 per cent on the four regular classes, and the
Pennsylvania at once announced still greater reductions.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The effect of this warfare on railroad revenues was sufficiently
serious to cause the Baltimore &amp; Ohio to recede somewhat from
its independent position and to enter into negotiations with the
Pennsylvania;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> but the terms of the resulting agreement proved
unsatisfactory to the other trunk lines, and no general pacification
was obtained. Late in 1875 rates nevertheless generally advanced,
and in December a general agreement was concluded, followed by a
general increase. This agreement was again hopelessly disrupted by
the following April, when cuts in east-bound rates followed each
other with rapidity. The published rates on grain, which had been 45
cents at the beginning of March, 1876, fell to 40 cents on March 7,
35 cents on April 13, 22½ cents on April 25, and 20 cents on May 5.
In June rates on west-bound freight fell to 25 cents first class to
Chicago, and 16 cents fourth and fifth class, actual rates going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
much lower; and it was possible to travel from New York to Chicago
first class for $13.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Warfare between railroads became intensified by the competition
between the cities which the railroads served, and by 1876 the
question of relative rates to New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore
had grown to be of primary importance.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> By an agreement in 1869
Baltimore had been given a differential on east-bound freight of 10
cents per 100 pounds, which had been reduced to 5 cents on grain in
1870. On west-bound freight Baltimore had enjoyed a differential in
1875 which had ranged from 10 cents on first class to 5 cents on
special class freight, and Philadelphia one which had been 2 cents
less except on first class, where the Philadelphia differential had
been 3 cents less than that to Baltimore. A temporary agreement
of March, 1876, had replaced these allowances by differentials
of 13 per cent in favor of Baltimore and 10 per cent in favor of
Philadelphia as against New York. This relation was fought over in
the rate war of 1876. In December of that year another agreement was
reached on the basis of equal rates from Western points to Europe on
export traffic via all four competing seaboard cities, and reduced
percentage differentials on local traffic to those cities; but this
proved temporary, the subsequent advances in rates were not general,
and final agreement was not secured until April, 1877. The contract
then executed was in the nature of a compromise. The differential
to Baltimore was reduced from 13 per cent to 3 cents, and from
Philadelphia from 10 per cent to 2 cents, to apply equally to local
and to export traffic. Rates to Boston were at no time to be less
than those to New York. Differentials on west-bound traffic were to
be the same as those on east-bound on third class, fourth class, and
special freight, and on first and second classes to be 8 cents less
per hundred from Baltimore and 6 cents less from Philadelphia than
from New York.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
The years following the agreement of 1877 were marked by low and
fluctuating rates, extensive cutting under the published schedules,
and frequent attempts at pooling and at apportionment of traffic. At
a meeting at Chicago on December 19, 1878, tariff rates were agreed
upon by all lines, but the existence of time contracts depressed
receipts for months thereafter. Another meeting on May 8 was
followed by sharp competition. In June an agreement to raise rates
was made, but proved unsatisfactory owing to long time contracts.
“During the period between December 18, 1878, and July 5, 1879,”
said Mr. King in a letter to the Trunk-Line Arbitrators on July 17,
1879, “the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company has practically been out of the
market, on account of the low rates by the Northern lines. It has
not secured enough east-bound freight to give return loads for the
small west-bound traffic sent over its lines to that city, and has
repeatedly moved its cars empty from Chicago to other points on its
lines east of that city.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Early in 1881 the cutting of rates became sufficiently important
to force official recognition by the chairman of the trunk-line
pool.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> By June 17 quoted rates on grain were 15 cents per 100
pounds from Chicago to New York, and a railroad war was in full
swing.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> By October the grain rate had been reduced from 15 cents
to 12½ cents; by August passenger fares were $7 from New York to
Chicago, and $16 from Chicago to New York, and there was quoted
besides a $5 Boston to Chicago rate over the Grand Trunk. The
radical nature of these cuts can be appreciated from Mr. Albert
Fink’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span> testimony before the Hepburn and Cullom Committees. Fifteen
cents, said he in 1879, just covered the actual cost of hauling the
grain;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> twenty cents, he asserted in 1885, was the bare cost of
movement, including the general expenses, but without any profit to
the road.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Grain was therefore not repaying the specific cost of
hauling, and passengers were obviously in similar case. Temporary
relief occurred through the large increase in business which took
place at the end of 1881. In October the Pennsylvania and the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio advanced east-bound rates because of the abundance
of traffic offering, and the New York Central, Erie, and Grand Trunk
followed to a less degree. In November further advances occurred,
though west-bound rates remained low; but throughout December and
January rates were low and fluctuating,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and negotiations were
carried on for the settlement of the differential question which
underlay the trouble. None of the combatants were open to conviction;
the only outlet was therefore arbitration, and this was reluctantly
resorted to.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> In January, 1882, the roads divided the through
trunk-line business, agreed to raise rates, and left the subject of
differentials to be investigated by Messrs. Thurman, Washburn, and
Cooley.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>This solution settled nothing. During the following three years
constant disputes arose over the proper division of traffic,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
and in 1884 the old struggle was resumed with unabated vigor. Rates
on grain to the seaboard fell from 30 cents to 20 cents on March
14 of that year, and to 15 cents on March 21; remaining low and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
fluctuating through the year.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Immigrant business from New York
to Chicago was handled by the Pennsylvania at one dollar a head. By
February, 1885, rates for traffic in both directions were completely
demoralized. Nominal east-bound charges on grain were 25 cents, or
a 10 cent advance since the preceding March, but actual rates were
as low as 8 and 10 cents. Meanwhile published rates on west-bound
freight were a third less than the standard tariff, and passenger
rates in both directions were, roughly, one-half the regular charges.
The following month still further reductions occurred. The warfare
was finally terminated by an agreement to maintain rates late in
1885,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> followed by an elaborate pooling agreement between the
competing lines.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>From 1875 to 1885 the trunk lines to the Atlantic ports were thus
engaged in active competition. What was the effect of this upon the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio? This road was highly prosperous in 1875. Dividends
of 6 per cent and 10 per cent were being paid. The capitalization
was small, and the management conservative. During the ten years
following 1875 the rate of dividend was not materially decreased.
In 1876 10 per cent was paid. In 1877 the old 8 per cent rate was
restored, and the following year the distribution was made in stock
instead of in cash. After the agreement of 1878 one-half year’s
dividend was paid in cash; and in 1879 9 per cent cash, and in
1880 10 per cent cash was declared, this rate enduring until 1886.
But although dividends were maintained, the effect of the railroad
wars appeared in the slowness with which net earnings increased. A
comparison of the net returns of 1884 with those of 1874 reveals
a gain of 40 per cent, on a mileage 27 per cent greater; but the
figures for 1885 show an increase of less than 2 per cent over those
for 1874, while the totals for 1884 were not again equalled until
1900. Meanwhile more bonds had been issued, and the percentage of
fixed charges to net earnings had increased from 16 in 1874 to 63
in 1884. In other words, money was borrowed to put into the road
which did little more than keep the net earnings from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span> declining.
In that same time the stock increased $2,900,000, and according to
the profit and loss account $15,559,636 were put into the property,
making a total of $55,743,092 (of this $37,197,696 were bonds); the
only result of which was the building of 313 miles of line, and the
securing of an increase in net earnings for 1884, which was swept
away the following year.</p>

<p>In 1884 the elder Garrett died, and his son Robert was elected to
succeed him. The old policy of independence and competition was
continued, the objective point being now an entrance into New York.
“When in 1885 the other trunk lines harmonized their differences,
...” said the Chronicle, “the Baltimore &amp; Ohio ... pursued its policy
of aggression.... The road must reach Philadelphia ... nay, must
push ... on to New York.... Instead of seeking to avoid rivalry, its
every effort seemed to encourage it. Rates were reduced, concessions
made to shippers and travellers, the one idea apparently being to get
traffic no matter what the cost.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The necessity of a secure New
York connection had been impressed upon the company in the course
of the rate wars. The first step was to be actual construction to
Philadelphia, the second, construction or traffic agreements from
Philadelphia to New York. Bonds were issued in April, 1883, for
construction of a so-called Philadelphia branch from Baltimore
to the northern boundary of Cecil County, Maryland,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> there to
connect with the Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia Railroad, which was being
built through Delaware and Pennsylvania to Philadelphia. Entrance
into Philadelphia was secured over the Schuylkill River East Side
Railway, a corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania and
doing business in the city only.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> The distance was approximately
ninety-nine miles; the cost was later asserted to have been
$20,000,000. Beyond Philadelphia the Baltimore &amp; Ohio relied on an
agreement with the Philadelphia &amp; Reading for trackage to Bound
Brook, New Jersey,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and on a traffic contract with the Central of
New Jersey for its line from Bound Brook to Elizabeth.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Terminals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
on Staten Island were secured by purchase of a controlling interest
in the Staten Island Rapid Transit Company,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and connection
between Elizabeth and the Island was obtained by new construction.
The strength of this route was in its directness and in its
independence of trunk-line control; its weakness was in its excessive
cost between Baltimore and Philadelphia, and in its reliance upon
traffic contracts north of the latter city. A proposition was
advanced to unite the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading,
and the Central of New Jersey with the Richmond Terminal System.
This, however, fell through,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and the possibility still existed
that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio might some day construct a line of its own
from Philadelphia to New York.</p>

<p>Pending the completion of the preceding arrangements rate conditions
remained naturally unsatisfactory. The Pennsylvania objected to
the paralleling of its Philadelphia-New York branch, and refused
to allow temporary use of that line by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio while
the latter’s independent connections were being established.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
Freight rates were slowly and painfully raised after the conflict
of 1884–5, and did not regain a high level. In 1886 the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio was forced to reduce its dividends from 10 to 8 per cent. The
following year it cut to 4 per cent, and in 1888 no dividend at all
was declared. The surplus on the year’s operations, which had not
since 1878 fallen below $1,000,000, dropped to $110,819 in 1885,
and to $36,259 in 1886. As dividends decreased, the funded debt
increased,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> the percentage of fixed charges to net income rose
from 63 to 89, and the floating debt attained the portentous amount
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span> $11,148,007. The only item which did not grow was net earnings.
There was nothing occult in the situation. Every one was well aware
that the competition to which the Baltimore &amp; Ohio had been subjected
had been severe, and that the cost of its New York extension had been
large. In 1887 the bonds outstanding were $56,868,201, the stock
$19,792,566, and the accumulated surplus $48,083,720, or a total of
$124,744,487. This stood for the sums invested in the property. Net
income on the other hand was $4,994,721; so that on an investment
of over $100,000,000 but 4 per cent was being obtained to cover
interest, improvements, and whatever dividend might be declared.</p>

<p>That no general apprehension was felt by investors before 1887 was
due to the great prestige which the Baltimore &amp; Ohio enjoyed. The
long series of dividends counted heavily in favor of the road.
The enormous accumulated surplus, said to have been invested in
valuable improvements and extensions;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> the enterprise of the
company in making extensions; the large volume of business; and the
confident statements of the president, all conspired to prevent a
too keen analysis of the business returns.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Relief of two sorts
was nevertheless required. In the first place the floating debt had
grown so large that some means of paying it off was necessary; in the
second place the road needed a sufficient reduction in fixed charges
to restore some of the margin of non-mortgaged earnings which had
been so great a safeguard in the early days. Only the first of these
requirements was met. Cash the road had to have; the existing fixed
charges, it was thought, it could endure if only some abatement of
the intensity of trunk-line competition could be obtained.</p>

<p>The method chosen for raising cash was the sale of bonds. In
September, 1887, J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. announced that a preliminary
contract had been entered into between the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad
Company and J. S. Morgan &amp; Co., Baring Bros. &amp; Co., and Brown,
Shipley &amp; Co., of London, and their allied houses in America, for the
negotiation of $5,000,000 Baltimore &amp; Ohio Consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span> 5s and of
$5,000,000 preferred stock, for the purpose of paying off the entire
floating debt, and of placing the company upon a sound financial
basis.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The consolidated bonds were to be part of an authorized
issue of $29,600,000, of which $21,423,000 were to be reserved to
retire the main stem mortgage indebtedness when it should fall due,
and $8,177,112 were to be exchanged for securities in the company’s
sinking fund, the freed securities to be used to pay the floating
debt in part. In case this exchange should not be made, $7,500,000 of
the issue might be sold direct, and the syndicate before mentioned
agreed to take $5,000,000 of this amount and to place $5,000,000 in
preferred stock on condition:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) That the statements of the company should be verified;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) That the management of the company should be placed in
competent hands, satisfactory to the syndicate;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) That satisfactory contracts should be made between the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio and other roads for New York business, which should
remove all antagonism between them on the subject, and should ensure
the permanent working of the first-named in entire harmony with the
other trunk lines, besides avoiding the construction, or the threat
of construction, of expensive lines north and east of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Annual payments to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio sinking funds were to be made
in the future in consols instead of in cash.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The essence of this arrangement was a funding of the floating debt,
plus agreements with other roads in order to maintain earnings. The
funding involved, however, a certain increase of charges through
the issue of bonds, while the agreements offered but a doubtful
chance of increased earnings. Only by an effective community of
interest or of ownership among the trunk lines could a saving have
been secured on which the new bond issues could safely have relied.
That this was to take place through the syndicate, that body was
emphatic in denying. “The statement,” said Vice-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>President Spencer,
“that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad has passed into the hands of a
syndicate, of which J. P. Morgan is the head, is absolutely without
foundation.... The syndicate has the greatest interest now in the
growth of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, and to secure this growth and
progress absolute independence of other corporate predominance is
essential, and the road must be worked in the interest of the states
and territories it reaches.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> This declaration left only informal
agreements as a resort; for pooling had been forbidden in 1887. It
did more, it implied the necessity of a maintenance of competition,
for to work the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in the interest of Baltimore meant
to work it against the interest of New York. In principle the plan
was nevertheless adopted. Bondholders saw no necessity for a radical
reorganization, and were willing to consent only to a new issue of
bonds. Certain modifications were, however, imposed. The exchange of
new bonds for securities in the sinking fund was abandoned, and the
alternative of direct sale was embraced. It was found impossible to
secure the consent of stockholders to an increase in the preferred
stock, three attempts to obtain the required authorization failing
in the week ending January 20, 1888.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Furthermore, the failure of
the stock issue led President Spencer<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> to request that the city
of Baltimore extend for five years at 4 per cent a $5,000,000 loan
to the company, which was to mature in two years, and that it return
the sinking fund of $2,400,000 which had accumulated in its hands for
the eventual cancellation of the debt.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> It may be added that this
suggestion was not accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
While awaiting final settlement of the syndicate scheme the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio obtained some cash from the disposal of all its free
resources; that is, from the telegraph, express, and sleeping-car
businesses which it had conducted since early in the administration
of John Garrett. In August, 1887, it sold its express business to
the United States Express Company for a period of thirty years, in
return for $1,500,000 of the capital stock of the express company
plus a certain percentage of the annual earnings of the express
lines handed over.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> In October of the same year its telegraph
business was turned over to the Western Union Telegraph Company in
return for $5,000,000 of the Western Union stock, and an annual
payment of $60,000 in cash.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Finally, in June, 1888, its
sleeping-car equipment and franchises were transferred to the Pullman
Company for a period of twenty-five years at a reported price of
$1,250,000.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> The company agreed to furnish all the sleeping and
parlor cars required. This brought the incidental advantage of ending
long-continued suits over patents. The terms of sale to the telegraph
and express companies brought in no ready money, but the securities
obtained were readily salable, and being independent for their value
of the commercial success of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio were available for
times of difficulty. It was this policy which offset the refusal of
the city of Baltimore to return the sinking fund to the company,
and which by March, 1888, rendered the road even to some extent
independent of the syndicate. At that date a modification of the
syndicate agreement took place. The bankers gave up all claim to the
$5,000,000 of stock so long under discussion, and took instead the
balance ($2,500,000) of the $7,500,000 consolidated mortgage bonds
which the company was authorized to sell. “The syndicate acted,” said
the Baltimore <cite>Sun</cite>, “in an entirely friendly spirit, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span> with a
desire to continue its financial relations with the company, took
the remaining $2,500,000 ... at a better price than was paid for the
$5,000,000.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>With temporary financial requirements provided for, President Spencer
was enabled to achieve some much-needed reforms. At a meeting of the
directors on March 14 a complete reorganization of the service was
authorized, with changes and transfers affecting employees from the
first vice-president down. Later a committee of mechanical experts
was organized “to examine thoroughly all the shops, shop tools, etc.,
of the entire Baltimore &amp; Ohio system, and to report on all the
improvements needed.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The form of the annual report was improved.
The much-quoted surplus, which had proved such an unreliable
support, was cut in two by the writing off of bad investments, the
marking down of the price of securities, and the like; and, finally,
a committee was appointed to make a general examination of the
financial as well as the physical condition of affairs.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> “Great
anxiety,” said a resolution of the directors, “exists in the public
mind as to the financial condition and the value and earning capacity
of the road and property ... [and] it is due to all interests that
a full, frank, and complete statement of its affairs should be made
public.” So far as lay in his power President Spencer, and through
him the syndicate, tried to secure a real and permanent improvement
in the condition of the road, and to gain, through increased
efficiency in operation, the margin which the refusal to cut down
fixed charges had denied. The failure of the attempt may be ascribed
to the continuance of the Garrett family in power. Any irregularities
or mistakes which had taken place in the past reflected on the
Garretts, so that it was to their interest to stifle investigation.
Moreover, any change in policy for the future implied a criticism
of their acts to which they were reluctant to accede. In 1888 the
Garrett holdings amounted to from 50,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span> to 60,000 shares out of a
total of 150,000 shares, or, deducting 32,500 shares held by the city
of Baltimore, which were not entitled to vote, to about one-half of
a total of 117,500 shares. This gave undisputed control. The effect
was seen in the annual election in November. Of 12 old members of the
board only 5 were reëlected, and of the 7 dropped 3 formed part of
the investigating committee engaged in securing “the full, frank, and
complete statement of the company’s condition” promised at an earlier
date.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The same month President Spencer was ousted and Mr. Charles
F. Mayer was elected in his place.</p>

<p>This revolution was fatal to any radical reform, so that during the
next seven years the condition of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio improved but
little. Net income grew, it is true, up to the panic year of 1893,
but fell so sharply after that that the reported figures for 1895
exceeded those of 1888 by but $1,283,843, and even this gain was
practically wiped out during the following year. Meanwhile fixed
charges grew from $6,550,972 in 1888 to $6,934,052 in 1895, and to
$7,303,781 in 1896; an increase which transformed the profits of
the company the following year into a deficit. A comparison of the
balance-sheets of 1888 and 1895 shows an increase of $10,207,434
in stock, of $16,261,000 in funded debt, and of $4,554,939 in
floating debt. These changes were offset mainly by increases in
bonds and stock owned, or in the hands of trustees, by advances to
subsidiary lines, and by a reduction of $11,080,000 in bonded debt
secured by collateral or by mortgage on the main line. During this
time dividends were nevertheless steadily paid on the preferred
stock, and, beginning in 1891, upon the common stock as well. The
liberal tendencies of the management were also evinced by a 20 per
cent dividend upon the common stock, declared in 1891 to compensate
shareholders for expenditures in betterments and improvements of
the physical condition of the property.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> It will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span> seen how
different this was from the policy of retrenchment and economy which
had been inaugurated by President Spencer, and which might fairly
have been expected from a corporation barely escaped from bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Traffic conditions from 1887 to 1893 were very far from satisfactory.
The difficulties between the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Pennsylvania
were indeed patched up, and the opening of the former’s lines to New
York rendered it independent of other trunk-line connections; but
frequent charges of rate cutting were made in 1887, and a war in
dressed-beef rates was inaugurated by the Grand Trunk in November
of that year. In 1888 rates were pretty much demoralized. Published
rates on grain dropped from 27½ cents in January to 20 cents in
October. Emigrant rates from New York to western points became the
subject of active competition; and, most important of all, the
dressed-beef controversy was pushed till it developed into a war
of the most active kind. The trouble here was started by cuts on
dressed beef by the Grand Trunk. In May other lines retaliated by
cuts in live-stock rates; by July 14 published rates on cattle from
Chicago to New York were 5½ cents per 100 pounds, and on dressed
beef and hogs 7 cents. In November the New York Central extended
the contest by a general reduction in west-bound rates.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> These
struggles, though terminated for a time by an agreement of February,
1889,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> seriously diminished railway revenues, and prevented the
rapid growth which the general prosperity of the country might have
occasioned.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> In fact, the Erie management stated in their annual
report for 1888 that their company had retired altogether from
certain classes of through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span> business for a time during the preceding
twelve months, owing to the unremunerative level of rates. Conditions
during the greater part of 1889 were better,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and during the
following three years constant attempts at agreement and arbitration,
joined with a considerable volume of business,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> prevented a long
continuance of any difficulties which arose.</p>

<p>It was perhaps traffic conditions such as we have described which
led the Garrett family to favor a community of interest scheme
which should improve the Baltimore &amp; Ohio connections with the
West. In June, 1890, Mr. E. R. Bacon formed a syndicate to control
the stock of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company. Acting in harmony with
the Garrett family, the syndicate was made up of Philadelphia, New
York, Baltimore, and Pittsburg capitalists, including the Richmond
Terminal, Pittsburgh &amp; Western, Northern Pacific, and Reading
interests. The plan was to establish a community of interest between
a vast network of lines reaching from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and from New York to the Mississippi. “The buyers,” it was said,
“came in simply as investors without condition that their other
properties would be benefited, although it was of course intimated
that something was to be done.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> They were required to pool
their stock for three years, and to give an irrevocable proxy
for that period to President Charles F. Mayer. The amount of the
syndicate purchase was 45,000 shares, of which 32,500 were obtained
from the city of Baltimore, and 9686 (preferred) from the state of
Maryland;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and the purchase brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span> the incidental advantage
of removing city and state from any direct interest in the road.
The preferred state stock the syndicate later exchanged for common
stock owned by the Johns Hopkins University. The purchase once made,
the pool was formed on well-known lines. The stock was deposited
with a trust company, trust certificates were issued, and proxies
transferred to Charles F. Mayer.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> The shares to be deposited were
limited in amount to 110,000; the actual amount put in was 89,750.
The results of the agreement were less sensational than the forecasts
made. It undoubtedly did much to promote friendly feeling among the
roads concerned. When, in 1891, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio was compelled
to vacate the Chicago terminals of the Illinois Central, which it
had occupied for years, it was able to make prompt arrangements with
a corporation controlled by the Northern Pacific for the use of its
facilities both for passengers and for freight. But the influence
of the Garrett family was not lessened, and inasmuch as the main
competitors of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio were not included there was no
check to competition, and earnings showed no striking change.</p>

<p>Matters stood thus at the beginning of 1893.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> No progress had
been made toward restoring the Baltimore &amp; Ohio to a permanently
stable condition, and the prosperity which its reports declared
was fictitious only. The reorganization to which bondholders had
refused to submit in the comparatively prosperous times of 1888 was
compelled by the depression following the panic of 1893. In 1894
earnings fell off. The gross earnings for the year ending June 30,
1893, were $26,214,807, and the net income $9,210,666; the following
year the same items were $22,502,662 and $8,719,830. The directors
reduced the dividend and called attention to the losses incurred
through protracted strikes in the coal and coke industry.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span> The
following January (1895) President Mayer stated that the fixed
charges, including the car trusts, sinking funds, etc., due January
1, amounting to nearly $1,000,000, had been paid without borrowing
one dollar. “I name this fact especially,” said he, “because it is
not unusual for us to make a loan for the unusually heavy payments
January 1. I doubt if the Baltimore &amp; Ohio has owed so small a
floating debt for twelve or fifteen years, perhaps longer, and it
never had the large volume of stocks and bonds it now has, something
over $16,000,000, not put down at their face value but rather at
their market value, or far below their intrinsic value. I can safely
say the road has not been in so strong a position as now for at least
fifteen years.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>It required more than confident statements by the managers, however,
to demonstrate the secure position of the road; and this all the more
because the acts of these gentlemen belied their public assertions.
Dividends on the common stock were passed in 1895, and again in
1896. The ratio of charges to earnings, according to the company’s
reports, rose from 75 per cent of net earnings in 1894 to 80.2 per
cent in 1895, and to 98.2 per cent in 1896; that is, less than 2 per
cent of the net earnings of $6,300,000 was admitted to be available
for dividends on $30,000,000 of stock.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Some relief was evidently
necessary. In January, 1896, it was announced that arrangements
had been made with a strong syndicate to provide for all immediate
financial requirements; but the appointment of receivers in February
could scarcely have come as a surprise. During the two weeks just
before the failure Mr. J. K. Cowen, who had succeeded Mr. Mayer
in the presidency, spent a great deal of time in New York trying
to borrow money to meet the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span> pressing demands. On his eventual
failure and return to Baltimore the directors felt that a friendly
receivership was the only resource.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>To the well-wishers of the road this failure may have seemed an
opportunity as well as a disaster. It was now possible to accomplish
what the management in 1888 had refused to attempt, <i>i. e.</i> a
reduction in the fixed charges of the company which should remove
the burdens under which the road had labored, and should open up the
way for a long period of improvement and prosperity. At least one
more unpleasant experience was, however, to be passed through. With a
view to determining the Baltimore &amp; Ohio’s real position, an expert
accountant, Mr. Stephen Little, had been set to work upon its books,
and from time to time notices had been appearing that he was at
work, that his examinations confirmed the statements of the company,
and that questions raised by hostile critics would be considered in
his report. Thus in April a reorganization committee, composed of
Messrs. Alexander Shaw, C. Morton Stuart, and six others, with whom
were deposited the Garrett shares, issued a circular referring to the
large amount of new capital, estimated by them at $30,000,000, which
had been received by the company since 1888 “without adequate or
satisfactory results,” and to the floating debt, which they asserted
had been increased from about $3,500,000 to $16,000,000. “We make no
charges, or even intimations of wrongdoing,” wrote their secretary,
“but desire and require that a full explanation of the management of
the property from the year 1888, when the road was set on its feet
by Mr. Morgan, shall be given, and that the causes which led to the
wrecking of the property shall be clearly shown.” To which another
committee, which directly represented the management, replied by
reference to Mr. Little.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>The much-heralded report came out in December, having been withheld
since the previous March for fear of the effect on the company’s
securities; and so far from sustaining the management, it contained
charges of irregularity almost as sensational as those made against
the Atchison at an earlier date. The books of the company, according
to Mr. Little, were in error to the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span> $11,204,858. During
the period of seven years and two months which his report covered he
found:</p>

</table>

<p>Deducting these sums from the annual income returns of the company,
he found that but $971,447 had been earned which had been properly
applicable to dividends, whereas $6,269,008 had been declared in the
seven years, of which $3,312,089 were cash and $2,956,920 stock.
Earnings had been increased by the most arbitrary of book-keeping
devices. In 1892 the value of the Western Union stock held in the
treasury since the sale of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio telegraph lines in
1888 had been written up $468,038, and the stock of another company,
the Consolidated Coal Company, had been written up $114,300. Not
only had advances to branch lines been entered as assets, but the
interest on these advances had been credited to income, the only
basis being that it was hoped that such interest would some day
be paid; and on the other side of the account, charges against
operating expenses had been charged to profit and loss on the same
principles by which the Garretts had rolled up their fictitious
surplus of 1888. Turning to the capital account, Mr. Little showed
an increase in liabilities from 1888 to 1895 of $22,180,000, not
including $5,481,835 representing chiefly the company’s endorsements
of notes of its subsidiary roads which stood here for the first time
revealed. This money apparently had been put into the property, and
yet Mr. Little’s corrected figures showed net earnings to be actually
smaller in 1895 than in the earlier years. Criticisms of the report
attached themselves mainly to the last items treated. That the
extensive endorsement of branch-line notes, absent as any mention
of the practice was from the annual reports, was most misleading
and unsound, nobody could deny;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span> but the broad question of what
charges during the seven years should have been paid out of income,
and what not, gave rise to lively discussion. Severe strictures
on Mr. Little’s statements were made by Patterson and Corwin, two
accountants appointed to re-examine the books of the company. “It
would appear,” said they, “that Mr. Little has made some curious
errors, and has been strikingly inconsistent.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Nevertheless
the more damaging of the latter’s accusations seem to have been
accepted, and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio took its place with other American
corporations, the managements of which have indulged in secret
juggling with the books.</p>

<p>Pending Mr. Little’s report, reorganization was of course delayed.
The receivers were then in control,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and under their direction a
vigorous policy of improvement was carried out. The rolling stock
of the system was found to be insufficient to handle its business,
and the motive power was in similar condition. All testified to
the consistent desire of the old management to employ every device
which might contribute to greater apparent earnings. Contracts for
5000 freight cars were let as early as May, 1896, to be paid for in
receivers’ certificates, and bids for 75 locomotives were at the same
time received.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> During their whole administration the receivers
purchased over 28,000 freight cars, 216 locomotives, 123,000 tons of
rails, besides ties, ballast, new steel bridges, and miscellaneous
improvements of various sorts.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> On the financial side they had to
resist an attempt to compel payment of dividends on the preferred
stock. The case dragged on through 1897 and 1898, and was finally
decided in favor of the company.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>After the publication of Mr. Little’s report there remained no
serious bar to reorganization, while the needs to be met were more
apparent than ever before. If the proportion of charges to earnings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
had been too heavy on the management’s own showing, how much more
burdensome was it when the reported earnings had been proved too
high, and the reported liabilities too low! The first step after the
appointment of receivers had been the springing up of reorganization
committees. The two most prominent were the Fitzgerald Committee,
representing the directors, and the Baltimore Committee. There
were besides committees representing the 5 per cent bonds of the
loan of 1885, the consolidated mortgage 5s, the 6 per cent bonds
of 1874, the preferred stock, and others. These were all to some
extent antagonistic. It was hoped to secure a reorganization without
foreclosure, but to provide against all contingencies a bill was
introduced and passed through the Maryland legislature, permitting a
new company to succeed, after reorganization, to the property of the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio system.</p>

<p>By April, 1898, a reorganization plan was ready, and was withheld
only on account, first of the threatened, and then of the actual,
war with Spain. Two months later this difficulty seemed no longer
serious, and a plan was formally announced.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> There were
contemplated two great issues of bonds and two of stock as follows:</p>

<table class="p1" summary="Bond and Stock issues">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">3½ per cent prior lien gold bonds,</td>
    <td class="tdr">$70,000,000</td>

    <td class="tdl">Common stock,</td>
    <td class="tdr">35,000,000</td>
    <td> </td></tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">These were to be parts of larger amounts authorized but not issued.
Thus the authorized amount of prior liens was $75,000,000, of which
$5,000,000 were to be reserved, and to be issued after January
1, 1902, at the rate of not exceeding $1,000,000 a year, for
enlargement, betterment, or extension of properties covered by the
prior lien mortgage; or for the acquisition of additions thereto.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
The authorized amount of first mortgage 4s was $165,000,000.
Since the prior liens matured in 1925, and this mortgage not
till 1948, $75,000,000 were reserved for retirement of the prior
issue. $7,000,000 were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span> further put aside for the new company;
$6,000,000 for the retirement of the Baltimore Belt Line 5s, and
$27,000,000 for enlargements, betterments, or extensions, etc.,
at a rate not exceeding $1,500,000 a year for four years, and not
exceeding $1,000,000 a year thereafter.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> The reserves from these
two mortgages, therefore, made liberal provision for new capital
requirements. All of the common stock authorized was to be issued at
once; but besides the $35,000,000 preferred stock before mentioned,
$5,000,000 preferred were to be held in reserve for the new company.</p>

<p>Of the immediate issues $60,073,090 prior liens, $36,384,535 first
mortgage 4s, $17,218,700 preferred stock, and $31,178,000 common
stock went toward the retirement of old securities; and $9,000,000
prior liens, $12,450,000 first mortgage 4s, and $16,450,000 preferred
stock were for cash requirements. The better of the old mortgages
received cash for their overdue interest, something over par in
prior liens for their principal, and from 12½ to 32 per cent in
first mortgage 4s and preferred stock to compensate for reductions
in their annual return. Inferior bonds received new first mortgage
4s with preferred stock (except in one instance) as a douceur. The
old stock, common and preferred, and the Washington City &amp; Point
Lookout 6s got mostly new stock for the principal of their holdings,
and preferred stock for their assessments. The fundamental principle
on which the exchanges were based was the retirement of old bonds
bearing high interest rates by an increased volume of new bonds
bearing lower rates; thus permitting a much smaller reduction in
fixed charges than occurred in other reorganizations which we shall
consider. To some extent reductions in annual yield were made up by
allowance of preferred stock. The consolidated mortgage 5s of 1887,
on which interest was reduced from $50 annually to $41.75, received
$85 in 4 per cent preferred stock as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span> compensation. The Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Loan of 1874 saw a reduction in interest from $60 to $40.41,
partially made up from the dividends on $160 of new preferred stock.
In fact, out of thirteen cases in which new bonds were given for
old, ten included an allowance of preferred stock, thus bringing the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio in line with other reorganizations of the period.
But the proportion of preferred stock given was small in each case,
and the principle was not well carried out.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>The cash requirements of the system were estimated at $36,092,500;
being swelled by arrears of interest, receivers’ certificates, need
for working capital, reorganization expenditures, and the like. The
plan proposed to cancel them by assessments on stockholders and by
the sale of securities before described. On the first preferred
stock, $2 a share was levied, $20 on the second preferred, and
$20 on the common stock, with a syndicate guarantee for each.
This netted $5,460,000. Stockholders received new preferred stock
for their payments. Deducting $5,460,000 preferred stock from the
securities reserved under the plan to be sold for cash, there
remained $9,000,000 prior liens, $12,450,000 first mortgage 4s, and
$10,990,000 preferred stock, or a total of $32,440,000; all of which
a syndicate agreed to take.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> In addition the company disposed
of securities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span> in the treasury, including $3,800,000 stock of the
Western Union Telegraph Company, for $3,500,000.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Both classes of stock were vested in five voting trustees, for a
period of five years. The trustees might, however, deliver the stock
at an earlier date in their discretion, and in fact did so in August,
1901. No additional mortgage was to be put upon the property, and
no increase in the amount of the preferred stock was to be made,
except in each instance after obtaining the consent of the holders
of a majority of the whole amount of preferred stock outstanding,
given at a meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose, and
the consent of the holders of a majority of such part of the common
stock as should be represented at such meeting, the holders of each
class of stock voting separately. During the existence of the voting
trust similar consent of holders of like amounts of the respective
classes of trust certificates was to be necessary for the purposes
indicated. Only a portion of the leased and dependent lines were
provided for in the plan, but the various cases were left to be
passed on separately. Thus the Baltimore Belt Line was finally leased
at a rental equivalent to 4 per cent on the outstanding 5 per cent
bonds; while the acquisition of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Southwestern
and the Central Ohio railroads involved the payment of a cash bonus,
and an increase in the preferred and common stock outstanding. The
mileage of the system suffered little change. Many of the branches
were sold at foreclosure, and bought in by the parent line; and a
glance at the balance-sheet in 1899 shows that besides the prior
liens and the first 4s, an issue of Pittsburg Junction and Middle
Division bonds was the principal tool employed. These securities,
bearing 3½ per cent, and falling due in 1925, were issued; 1st, to
retire branch-line securities, and to weld the system into one united
whole; and 2d, to provide new capital for enlargement and betterment
and extension.</p>

<p>The success of this Baltimore &amp; Ohio reorganization plan was very
largely due to the time at which it was put through. In other words,
the reorganization was completed just when an unparalleled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span> era of
prosperity was fairly under way. The moderate reduction in fixed
charges which it secured proved more than adequate when earnings
rapidly grew. The net earnings of the property for the year ending
June 30, 1898, were estimated at $7,724,758, and the new fixed
charges were set at $6,252,351.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Net earnings for 1899 were
$6,621,599. In 1900, on a mileage 11 per cent greater, they were
$12,359,443, and fixed charges were $6,831,463 only. In subsequent
years, with an increase both in mileage and in earnings, the margin
between charges and income further increased. In 1903 $3,500,000 were
spent out of earnings for additions and improvements; $7,370,482 were
declared in dividends; and $2,947,681 were carried to surplus. In
1907 $3,000,000 were spent in additions and improvements, $6,965,245
paid in dividends, $7,480,385 carried to surplus. This situation was
in no way due to the reorganization plan, and would have restored the
company to solvency even if no reorganization had taken place. It may
be said that the receivership did much to enable the road to take
advantage of the later prosperity. The character of the receivers’
work has been mentioned. By June 30, 1899, they had spent as much as
$17,000,000 for cars alone, $2,500,000 for locomotives, $2,100,000
for rails, and other sums for improvements and renewals of all kinds.
The maintenance of way pay-rolls in three years amounted to nearly
$12,000,000, and the total expenditure aggregated about $35,000,000;
of which $15,000,000 were secured by the issue of receivers’
certificates, and the balance through car trusts, earnings from the
property, and from the reorganization managers.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> This was an
indispensable and invaluable preliminary to a growth in earnings, but
was, however, distinct from the financial problems of reorganization.
In brief, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio increased its nominal capitalization
more, and reduced its fixed charges less than any of the seven other
reorganizations of the nineties which we shall consider except the
Erie. Its need was perhaps less crying, but not sufficiently so to
explain the difference.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, while provision had early been made for
foreclosure, it had been hoped to avoid such a drastic step. Hopes in
this respect were fulfilled, and while a number of branch lines were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
sold the main stem escaped. Vigorous objections to the plan came from
the preferred stock, which was in 1898 suing to compel payment of its
dividends. In July, at a meeting of shareholders it was declared to
be the sense of the meeting that the preferred stock could not justly
be required to determine whether it would accept the proposition
published by the reorganization committee before the case in the
Supreme Court should be decided.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> Late in July an injunction was
obtained, which, however, was dissolved in October. Still later in
that year the suits were settled by the sale of the bulk of the
first preferred stock to the reorganization committee.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> The only
other considerable complaint came from the holders of the 4½ per
cent Baltimore &amp; Ohio Terminal bonds, and was a protest against the
reduction of ½ per cent in their interest without, as they said, the
smallest compensation. Suits for the foreclosure of the mortgages
of 1887, 1872, and 1874 were instituted in October, 1898. Decrees
were obtained in February. Decrees were also given against the
Philadelphia Division, the Parkersburg Branch, the Staten Island
Rapid Transit Company, and others. Separate receivers had previously
been appointed for the Sandusky, Mansfield &amp; Newark, the Central
Ohio, the Washington Branch, and others. Decrees were not asked for
against the main line. In August, 1898, only three months after the
publication of the plan, the reorganization managers were able to
pronounce it effective.</p>

<p>The receivers surrendered control July 1, 1899,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> and the company
started on its new career amid a buzz of satisfaction from all who
had participated in its reorganization. In an address before the
Maryland Bar Association Mr. John K. Cowen summarized the result as
follows:</p>

<p>(1) Every bondholder of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad has received
new securities which substantially pay his full debt. In other words,
the bondholders have been paid in full.</p>

<p>(2) The floating debt creditors have received every cent of their
indebtedness.</p>

<p>(3) The first preferred stockholders have received in cash 75 per
cent of the par value of their stock, the court overruling their
claim of preference over the bondholders and creditors. The second
preferred stockholders have received securities which, after payment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of the assessment, net about $70 per share, at the market price, and
at times over $80 net could have been realized.</p>

<p>(4) The common stockholders, instead of being wiped out, have
received their common stock in the new company upon paying an
assessment, the net amount of which (because of the value of the
securities received for such assessment) would not exceed $5 or $6.</p>

<p>(5) The company saves its old charter for whatever value may be
attached to it.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>This statement presents the favorable side of the picture. On the
whole, securityholders were tenderly handled, though the bondholders
were by no means paid off in full. And on the other hand, this very
tenderness made a voluntary reorganization possible, whereby the
charter of the company was saved. The pertinent objections were from
the point of view of the company itself, and these were silenced by
the increase in earnings.</p>

<p>Since reorganization the Baltimore &amp; Ohio has been enjoying great
prosperity. On a mileage operated, which was some 1800 miles greater
in 1907 than in 1900,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> it earned a return increased by over
$40,000,000; while its income from dividends and interest mounted
from less than half a million to over $3,000,000. Ton mileage figures
were about 11,300,000,000 in 1907 as against 6,800,000,000 in 1900;
passenger mileage had grown from 459,000,000 to 723,000,000. This
prosperity has but reflected the condition of the country at large,
but the Baltimore &amp; Ohio has taken advantage of it in far-sighted
fashion. No less than $17,000,000 have been spent from earnings
for additions and improvements between June 30, 1899, and June 30,
1907, not to mention maintenance of way expenditures which have
ranged from about $1500 to over $2500 per mile of road operated.
Besides the provision made by the reorganization plan, $15,000,000
convertible debentures were issued under date of March 1, 1901, for
new construction and improvements. There were authorized $40,000,000
of common stock in November, 1901, to go in part for improvements,
and the bulk of $27,750,000 new common stock of 1906 will be applied
to similar ends. As a result the company’s equipment has largely
increased, grades have been reduced, curves straightened, light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
rails replaced by heavy, and subsidiary track increased. There were
two miles of second, third, and fourth track and sidings for every
three miles of main track in 1900; there were three miles to every
four in 1907. A considerable increase in average freight train
load has accordingly occurred. In 1900 the average load was 366
tons; in 1907 it was 433.02. That this figure has not still more
greatly increased from the 406.53 tons of 1901 is probably due to
the somewhat greater proportion of manufactures handled and to a
considerable decrease in average distance hauled, and is compensated
for by an increase of over one cent in the average rate received.</p>

<p>The events of most vital importance in the Baltimore &amp; Ohio’s recent
history have been connected with its control. In September, 1898,
Philip D. Armour, Marshall Field, and Norman D. Ream, executors
of the Pullman estate, together with James J. Hill of the Great
Northern, bought a large interest in the stock, though whether or
not sufficient to control no one knew. From statements by Mr. Cowen
it would appear that the deal was somewhat similar to the earlier
one in which the Northern Pacific had been interested: that is, it
involved the sale of Baltimore &amp; Ohio stock to secure the good will
of men strong enough to support the road in case of difficulty, and
influential enough to open desirable connections or to modify the
stringency of competition. “The recent transaction,” said Mr. Cowen,
“has been the realization of my hopes about the future of the road.”
It was not Mr. Hill’s influence, however, that was destined to be
dominant. By the end of the year rumors connected the Pennsylvania
with the purchase of an interest in the property, and the election
of Mr. S. M. Prevost, third vice-president of that company, to a
directorship, gave assurance of the truth of the reports. It was,
of course, impossible to purchase actual control so long as the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio stock remained in trust; but the trustees seemed
very ready to accord to new buyers that representation and influence
to which their stock might give them claim. At the annual election
in November, 1900, an additional representative of the Pennsylvania
was elected to the board, showing the probable increase of the
Pennsylvania holdings, and the following year an absolute majority
was said to have been passed, the shares held by Mr. Hill and his
associates, and apparently sold to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span> Pennsylvania, being thought
to contribute powerfully to that result.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> In May, Mr. Hill and
Mr. Charles H. Tweed, chairman of the Southern Pacific, resigned
from the directorate, to be replaced by two further representatives
of the Pennsylvania. In June, President Cowen was replaced by Mr.
S. F. Loree, fourth vice-president of the Pennsylvania lines west of
Pittsburg, and in August the voting trust was dissolved.</p>

<p>The last step has been the sale of part of the Pennsylvania
holdings to the Union Pacific system. It appears that the former’s
interest in the company was largely due to anxiety over the coal
situation. Before 1895 rates on bituminous coal had been depressed
and demoralized. Rebates had been freely given in spite of any
agreements which could be arranged. Under these circumstances the
Pennsylvania had determined to buy enough stock of the Chesapeake &amp;
Ohio, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, and the Norfolk &amp; Western companies to
control the policies of these roads, and, through stock ownership
in the Reading by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, to influence that company
also.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Unfortunately for the project public attention became
concentrated on the coal industry at this time because of the
discovery of certain flagrant abuses, and it seemed wise for the
Pennsylvania to dispossess itself of a part of its stock.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> The
Union Pacific was in the market with large resources derived from its
sale of Great Northern and Northern Pacific stock. It was out of the
question for the Pennsylvania to sell its shares to a competitor,
but there was less objection to a sale to Mr. Harriman, providing a
reasonable portion should be retained. Accordingly, the Pennsylvania
sold and the Union Pacific interests bought, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span> October, 1906,
some $39,540,600 in Baltimore &amp; Ohio common and preferred stock,
being in the neighborhood of half of the former’s holdings. This
is the present situation of the property. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio is
independent, in the sense that it is not controlled by any single
interest, but large amounts of its stock are owned by its competitor,
the Pennsylvania, and by its connection, the Harriman system. On the
whole the alliance with these interests augurs well for the future of
the company.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> New York &amp; Erie Railroad was organized in 1833 in the hope
of bringing to the southern tier of counties in New York State a
prosperity equal to that which the Erie Canal had secured for the
northern tier. It was to run from New York or some suitable point
in its vicinity to Lake Erie. A six foot gauge was adopted, partly
because the grades encountered were thought to require locomotives
with more power than a narrower gauge could accommodate, and partly
because it was wished to make the road independent of any connection
which might lead trade away from the city of New York.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>The events of the early years may be briefly dealt with. Difficulty
was experienced in getting subscriptions, and in 1836 the legislature
granted a loan of $3,000,000. An assignment was made in 1842, due to
the difficulty of getting the enterprise under way, which resulted in
the release of the company from liability to the state on condition
that it complete its line from the Hudson to Lake Erie by 1851.
Stockholders were to exchange two shares of old for one share of
new stock, and a first mortgage of $3,000,000 was authorized.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
In 1851 the line was completed to Dunkirk on Lake Erie, and the
following year it reported a bonded indebtedness of $14,000,000,
capital stock of $6,000,000, and floating debt to the amount of
$3,080,000, or a total of $43,961 per mile of line; a high figure,
but probably necessarily so in view of the difficult work to be
performed. Although nominally completed, the troubles of the road
were not over; and a precarious existence was maintained only by
the placing of additional loans in 1852 and 1855, and by the aid
of Daniel Drew on two distinct occasions. A war of rates with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span> the
New York Central aggravated the situation; heavy storms and ice
floods in January, 1857, caused serious loss, and the panic of that
year, with the ensuing depression, proved more than the road could
stand. Proceedings were begun in 1859 by the trustees of the fourth
mortgage, and in August a receiver was appointed.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> The wonder was
that such action had been delayed so long. The income of the road
had been so far short of meeting current expenses that claims for
labor, supplies, rents, and unpaid taxes, and judgments rendered
against the company before the receivers were appointed, had mounted
up to $741,510; while not only had interest on three mortgages
fallen due in April, May, and June, but the principal of the second
mortgage, amounting to $4,000,000, had matured. The settlement of
claims and the reorganization of the company were put in the hands
of J. C. Bancroft Davis and Dudley S. Gregory. Since the earnings of
the road were at so low an ebb, wisdom would have seemed to dictate
some scaling of the charges to correspond. This did not enter into
the views of the trustees; instead, they proposed to give preferred
stock for all unsecured indebtedness, to extend the principal of
the second mortgage coming due, to exchange old common stock for
new, to levy an assessment of 2½ per cent on both classes of new
stock, and with the proceeds of the assessment to pay all coupons
in arrears. Provision was made for the retirement of certain fourth
mortgage bonds, and for a sale under foreclosure of that mortgage.
By the arrangement no saving in fixed charges worth mentioning was
secured; no sacrifice was demanded of bondholders; and, save for the
payment of assessments and the (new) stock given for floating debt,
the stockholder’s position was not made worse. The scheme was an
easy and temporary means of escape from an embarrassing position.
Before the reorganization the bonds outstanding had amounted to
$18,006,000, the stock to $11,000,000, and the unsecured indebtedness
to $8,504,000. After reorganization the totals were: indebtedness,
$17,953,000, and stock, $19,911,000 (of which $8,911,000 preferred);
or a capitalization of $67,728 per mile. The road was sold in 1862,
and the Erie Railway took the place of the original New York &amp; Erie
Railroad Company.</p>

<p>With 1864 began the career of the Erie as a speculative Wall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span> Street
stock. Its large capitalization and the painful slowness with which
its earnings grew kept the quotations of its shares normally at a
low figure and invited speculation; while the location of its lines
tempted more serious efforts to obtain control. Up to 1867 Daniel
Drew was in power, while Commodore Vanderbilt spent his best efforts
to drive him out; after that date Jay Gould and Jim Fisk became
more and more prominent, and manipulated the Erie securities with
enthusiastic regard to profits which they might derive both from the
Erie Company itself and from operators who wished to speculate in
its stock. In the course of the abundant litigation to which Gould’s
methods gave rise, various receivers were appointed; but the orders
of appointment were subsequently vacated, and the receiverships were
nominal only. The details of the Wall Street struggles have little
interest for us here.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> But the result is of importance. In the
eight years from 1864 to 1872, when Gould was turned out of Erie by
General Sickles and his English backers, the bonded indebtedness of
the company increased from $17,822,900 to $26,395,000, and the common
stock from $24,228,800 to $78,000,000; in the one case a growth of 48
per cent and in the other of 221 per cent, at a time when the mileage
increased 53 per cent and the net earnings but 22 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
No more disgraceful record exists for any American railroad. The
stock was not issued for the sake of improving the road, and it was
subsequently shown that the road was not improved; but it was thrown
upon the market at critical times in support of bear operations by
the Erie managers, while portions of it, on at least one occasion,
were bought back with the funds of the company to aid speculation for
a rise. The result was to ruin the credit of the Erie, and to make
it the favorite tool of cliques of gamblers. The increase in bonds
occasioned an unmistakable increase in fixed charges, which rose
from 20 per cent of gross earnings in 1864 to 25 per cent in 1871,
21 per cent in 1872, and 30 per cent in 1873, while the purchase of
worthless bonds of subsidiary roads, such as the Boston, Hartford &amp;
Erie, lessened the assets without disclosing the real position to the
casual observer.</p>

<p>In 1872 the control of Erie was taken from Gould through a vigorous
campaign managed by General Daniel E. Sickles, and an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span> “eminently
respectable” board of directors was elected. Temporary relief was
obtained from the use of $6,000,000, available from an issue of bonds
previously approved,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> and dividends, first on the preferred and
then on both preferred and common stock were declared. Unfortunately
the dividends were not earned; and this fact, which was suspected
from the previous record of the company and the marvel of its so
early restoration to a dividend basis, was shown in the statements
of ex-Auditor S. H. Dunan, who resigned in March, 1874, alleging
that the accounts had been falsified to suit the company’s purposes,
and that he was unwilling any longer to be a party thereto.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
Investigations conducted by representatives of English bondholders
showed that in the three years ending in September, 1875, the profits
of the road had been $1,008,775 instead of $5,352,673 as stated in
the company’s accounts; and the severity of this finding was scarcely
mitigated by the conclusion that in the opinion of the committee
the dividends on the preferred stock at least were justified by the
books.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> At the same time the report of Captain Tyler, another
English representative, laid emphasis on the necessity for a change
of gauge, a double track, improvements in gradient, fresh extensions
and connections, and other similar matters.</p>

<p>The real position of the company at the time was shown but too well
by the frequency of strikes upon its road. Thus in February, 1874,
a strike of freight brakemen on the Susquehanna division broke out,
caused principally by an order to discharge one of the brakemen from
each freight crew, leaving only three on a train; and at the same
time there was a strike of the switchmen on some of the divisions
owing to a decrease in pay. In March occurred a serious strike
among the employees of the road in Buffalo, mainly on account of
irregularity and delay in payment of wages, and, finally, in April,
there was trouble both in the Susquehanna shops and in the Jersey
City freight yard over this same cause. The indications afforded by
these troubles were borne out by the figures of the annual reports.
The gross earnings of 1874 were $1,413,708 less than those of 1873,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
while the decrease in operating expenses was so slight as to reduce
net earnings by nearly the same amount. If, now, there is deducted
from the net earnings of the years 1871–3, inclusive, the sum which
the London accountants declared to have been improperly reported as
profits, there results an average of $4,175,699 net; or less than the
net earnings for either 1864, 1865, or 1866, although the average
charges for the years mentioned exceeded the average of the earlier
period by $1,769,060 each year. These figures exclude the influence
of the panic of 1873, which, as has been seen, caused a still further
falling off in the earnings of the company. It was a time, moreover,
when the Erie could not be content to sit still and wait, for
competition was daily becoming more severe. By 1874 the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio, the New York Central, and the Pennsylvania had connections with
Chicago, and the Erie was competing with them for business by means
of traffic agreements with connecting lines. The next decade was to
see the bitterest rate wars that the country has ever known; and the
Erie, with its exceptional gauge and single track, was to compete
with rivals of normal gauge, who were adding third and fourth tracks
to the two which they already possessed. The one bright spot was the
development of the coal traffic, which in 1874 formed the greatest
item of the Erie’s tonnage, and was in a measure apart from the
competition of other lines.</p>

<p>Suit was brought in July, 1874, for the appointment of a receiver.
The complaint reviewed alleged improper acts of the management in
declaring dividends, in buying Buffalo, New York &amp; Erie stock and
sundry coal lands, and in issuing the new $30,000,000 mortgage before
mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> In October the Attorney-General of New York instituted
suit on nominally the same grounds; not, as he explained, in the
expectation that the appointment of a receiver would be required,
but in order that this action might be taken if the conduct of the
directors should make it necessary. Still other suits were begun
before the year was out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the management was changed. Whether or not Mr. Watson,
who had been president since 1872, had done all humanly possible to
set the Erie on its feet, his administration was not unnaturally in
bad odor after the charges of Dunan and the report of the London
accountants, to say nothing of the admittedly low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span> earnings for the
year 1874. An attempt was made to secure the very best man possible
for the presidency, and to support him in necessary reforms, in the
hope of some different results from those with which securityholders
had become familiar. The man for the place was thought to be Mr.
H. J. Jewett, a railroad man then in Congress from Ohio; and this
gentleman was accordingly secured at an extremely liberal salary.
Soon after his election a ten per cent cut in salaries was decreed,
and an examination of the accounts of the stations along the line
in behalf of the company was begun. It was too late, however, for
the company. The business of the last of 1874 and first of 1875 was
poor; floods in the spring damaged the property of the road, and
rumors of a receivership were rife. On May 22 a private meeting of
stockholders in New York passed resolutions to the effect that the
borrowing of money by the sale of 7 per cent bonds at 40 cents on the
dollar, and other means adopted by the Watson administration, would
inevitably result in bankruptcy; that sound interest required that
the money needed to pay interest should be raised by an assessment
on the stockholders, and that the directors should be thereby
requested to open books to examination, and to invite stockholders
to contribute voluntarily a sum sufficient to keep the company from
immediate failure.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> The proposal showed a proper spirit, but was
impracticable. Four days later Mr. Jewett was appointed receiver on
application of representatives of the Attorney-General and of the
Railroad.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>This was the second receivership which the Erie had had to face,
and the situation was materially worse than at the previous
failure. According to the statement of President Jewett the funded
indebtedness in May, 1875, amounted to $54,394,100, and the fixed
charges to $5,059,828; while the net earnings for the previous nine
months had decreased 13.4 per cent from the corresponding period
for the previous year, and a serious deficit was in view. Temporary
measures of relief had served but to drag the company further into
the mire;<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> and, most important of all, the causes for the existing
difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span> were of a permanent nature, so that the future gave
promise of still harder conditions than had existed in the past.
What was needed was a reorganization which should undo the evil work
of Gould, Fisk, Drew, and their associates, and which should secure
the margin of surplus earnings which the reorganization of 1859–62
had failed to provide. Perhaps the chief difficulty lay in the fact
that the men who were responsible for the increased capitalization
were not at all those on whom the brunt of reconstruction would fall;
for while the managers of the road had been Americans, the gullible
investors had been Englishmen; and it was reported that much of the
watered stock of the Gould régime had been unloaded on the English
market.</p>

<p>Committees sprang up promptly. The most important of them were the
English committees of bond- and stockholders, soon consolidated under
the chairmanship of Sir Edward Watkin. On August 7, Sir Edward left
England on a visit of inspection, accompanied by Mr. Morris, counsel
for the bondholders. Conference with the board of directors and with
President Jewett followed, and a provisional scheme of adjustment was
decided upon. In his report to his English constituents Sir Edward
outlined the results. Current indebtedness, said he, was $42,180,075;
estimated net revenues for the year ending in June last were
$3,715,609; operating expenses had been for that year 79 per cent,
due largely to the cost imposed by exceptional gauge, while the chief
lines with which the Erie competed showed proportions of only from 60
to 66 per cent. Out of fourteen branches only three showed a profit
above rentals, and pay-rolls had ordinarily been months in arrears.
These facts were familiar; the remedy proposed was unfortunately
familiar as well. “Let it be hoped,” said this English financier,
“that the bond- and stockholders will have the courage now to submit
to a period of self-denial, and will consent to pay their debts and
complete essential obligations out of available net profits, the
bondholders receiving in place of cash such equitable obligations,
realized out of surplus revenue in the future, as each, according
to right of priority, may justly expect.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> What could this have
meant save an issue of stock or income bonds for coupons falling due,
with the result of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span> adding to the unwieldy capitalization of the road
instead of reducing it as should have been done! For the rest, Sir
Edward Watkin concluded with Mr. Jewett the following arrangement:</p>

<p>(1) Three nominees of the bond- and stockholders’ committee proposed
by Watkin were to take seats in the Erie board;</p>

<p>(2) Mr. Morris was to be associated with counsel for the receiver and
for the company, and was to be regarded and treated as one of the
professional agents and officers of the undertaking;</p>

<p>(3) Mr. Jewett was to transmit a memorandum of his views on
reorganization;</p>

<p>(4) Net earnings were to be retained for a while, and bondholders
were to have a voice in their expenditure. Thus a vote was to be
taken under the charge of the stock- and bondholders’ committee in
London on the constitution of a committee of consultation, consisting
of representatives of each class of bondholders and of preferred
and ordinary stock, and that committee was to designate a special
representative whose consent and approval were to be taken by Mr.
Jewett in the expenditure of net earnings;</p>

<p>(5) Monthly reports of actual earnings and expenditures, together
with reports from the president and receiver, were to be regularly
transmitted to the office of the committee in London;</p>

<p>(6) Bond- and stockholders were to be urged to give power of attorney
and proxies to Watkin, or to such other person or persons as the
above representatives of the bond- and stockholders should designate;</p>

<p>(7) Any scheme of reorganization was to include a provision giving
bondholders a voting power.</p>

<p>On the above resolutions Jewett, with his board, and Watkin, with
his committee, agreed to coöperate.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> Under the circumstances the
increased power given the bondholders was both a natural and a just
demand, and it is probable that Mr. Jewett’s prompt acquiescence
in it had something to do with Sir Edward’s advice to the
securityholders “to rely on the honor, as I feel you may also upon
the anxious labors and full experience of the President and Receiver.”</p>

<p>The report did not go uncriticised. It was pointed out, first, that
a majority of English proprietors could not unhesitatingly share the
confidence expressed in Mr. Jewett; second, that the first mortgage
bondholders were well secured, and would surely refuse to fund<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span> their
indebtedness; and third, that the payment of the floating debt,
according to the Watkin plan, would simply create another debt of
equal or greater amount due to the bondholders whose coupons were
not paid. The only sound way, said a committee of bondholders in
Dundee in a letter to the Watkin Committee, is resolutely to shun
an accumulation of mortgage liabilities on the one hand, and on
the other to give increased reality to the bonds and stocks of the
company already existing as items in capital account, <i>i. e.</i> an
assessment on the stock and a sweeping reduction in the interest on
the bonds secured by the second mortgage:—the first mortgage bonds
are in different case—they represent investment of cash instead of
mere water, and even if foreclosure is difficult, they have beyond
question an absolutely good security for the ultimate payment of both
principal and interest.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>In September, 1875, a plan of reorganization was anonymously put
forward as follows: Instead of assessment on the shareholders, it
suggested the issue of 50 per cent more common stock; one new share
for every two shares then existing. If a price of $25 per share could
be obtained a total of $10,000,000 cash would be thereby secured.
Besides the new stock issued bond- and preference-holders were to
capitalize their interest for two years in bonds or shares bearing
their present priorities. This funding should yield $8,000,000;
and the $18,000,000 in all obtained was to be expended on the road
over the next two years, during which period the new shares were to
be paid up by half-yearly instalments. With the line furnished and
equipped as proposed, continued this optimistic plan, the working
expenses could be reduced from 79 per cent to 60 per cent, and the
traffic within three years would be at least $24,000,000 per year,
affording a net revenue of $9,600,000 per annum, sufficient to meet
all bond and preference liabilities and to leave 3 per cent for the
ordinary charges.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> The all sufficient criticism to this plan was
that it required too great a combination of favorable circumstances
to ensure its success. In some respects, however, it was not unlike
the plan ultimately adopted.</p>

<p>Two months later appeared a plan by Mr. John C. Conybeare, an
English bondholder, which was superior to the foregoing in that
it proposed an assessment, and made some slight provision for an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
ultimate reduction in fixed charges. Mr. Conybeare proposed to assess
preferred stock $11 and common stock $9. Payment of the assessment
was not to be compulsory, but was to have the effect of giving to the
stock which did pay a right to dividends before anything should be
received by that which did not pay. Shares of the company by the plan
would thus have ranked as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Preferred shares on which assessment had been paid, entitled to 7
per cent dividends before any other dividends were paid.</p>

<p>(2) Preferred shares on which no assessment had been paid, with
rights inferior to the preferred A shares, but superior to the common
shares.</p>

<p>(3) Common stock on which assessment had been paid, entitled to 4 per
cent before further dividend on the common.</p>

<p>(4) Unprivileged, unassessed common stock which was to take what
there was left.</p>

<p>In addition there was to be a pre-preference 8 per cent stock,
ranking before all the above, which was to be issued to exchange in
part for second preferred and convertible bonds. First consolidated
bonds and sterling bonds of 1865 were to accept one or two per cent
of their 7 per cent interest in bonds, secured perhaps by the coal
property of the company, while the second consolidated and the
convertible gold bonds were to receive 4 per cent in gold and 3
per cent in the new pre-preference stock as above. To the obvious
possibility that the stockholders would refuse to pay an assessment
the plan opposed no remedy. In this case the very moderate amount of
interest funded would have been the only relief secured.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>These plans were, however, but preliminary to the elaborate Watkin
scheme which appeared in December. The most prominent feature herein
was, as previously indicated, the funding of coupons, both those
past due and those to become due for a time into the future. Given
net earnings sufficient to meet fixed charges, the postponement of
interest by this plan would obviously have released revenue with
which to make needed improvements on the road. This funding was
to be, however, limited to the first consolidated 7s, convertible
sterling 6s, second consolidated 7s, and convertible gold 7s; the six
earlier issues were to be left untouched. One permanent reduction was
also to be made, in that for the second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span> mortgage and convertible 7s
were to be given two classes of ninety-year gold bonds: the first
for 60 per cent of the principal, with interest at 6 per cent, and
payable in bonds of the same class from the dates of default until
March, 1877, and thereafter in gold; the second for 40 per cent of
the principal, carrying 4 per cent until 1881 and thereafter 5 per
cent, payable only out of net earnings. To start the company on its
way and to meet present obligations an assessment was proposed of
three dollars on the preferred and six dollars on the common stock,
in return for which 5 per cent income bonds were to be given; while
finally the dividends on the preferred stock were to be reduced
from 7 to 6 per cent, and foreclosure was contemplated, so that
the opposition of an irreconcilable minority might be more easily
overcome.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> According to the figures in the Watkin plan, the old
and new capitalization and interest compared as follows:</p>

<p>The amount of capital stock was unchanged.</p>

<p>The net earnings for 1874–5 had been $3,715,609, and those from
1871–3 inclusive, with the deductions declared proper in the report
of the London accountants, had averaged $4,175,699 each year, so
that a safe margin seemed to intervene. The extent of the margin
depended, however, on the fixed charges, such as rentals, over and
above interest on the funded debt; and although it was proposed to
cancel burdensome leases and contracts the actual leeway after 1880
was to be very small indeed. To speak briefly, the plan was definite
but not sufficiently radical to meet conditions which were likely
to arise. In counting upon the ability of the company to spare
considerable sums from revenue for improvements during the next few
years, it was leaning on a broken reed; in increasing the nominal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
amount of bonded indebtedness, it was making a step in the wrong
direction; and by interposing additional claims on earnings while
leaving the volume of stock the same, it took from the stockholders
any very lively interest in the road’s future welfare. The plan was
nevertheless accepted by the English securityholders, subject to such
modifications as might afterwards be found desirable.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>The next step was to obtain the unanimous acceptance of this Watkin
scheme. Messrs. Robert Fleming and O. G. Miller were accordingly sent
to New York in February, 1876, to consult with the officers of the
company and the securityholders in America. No very vigorous interest
was taken on this side, but the Erie directors appointed a committee
to confer with the English representatives, and discussions took
place for something over a month. The committee criticised the plan
proposed from the point of view of the stockholders; they maintained
that it would destroy all their interest in the property unless
they made further sacrifices, which they were unable to do, and
suggested that the funding of from four to eight coupons by the first
consolidated, gold convertible, and second consolidated bonds was
all that would be needed to put the road in a prosperous condition,
provide for steel rails, and for the narrowing of the gauge.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>
This was so plainly inadequate that it is a matter of surprise that
it was entertained by the English committee; and even they insisted
that the stockholders agree to put a majority of the $86,000,000 of
stock in the hands of the bondholders as a preliminary, and would do
no more than lay the proposal before their constituents.</p>

<p>On their return home in April Messrs. Miller and Fleming stated that
the essential conditions to a successful reorganization were:</p>

<p>(1) An effective control of the management by the real owners,—the
bondholders;</p>

<p>(2) The restoration of the equilibrium between the compulsory
interest charge on the mortgage debt and the minimum net earnings;</p>

<p>(3) A change of gauge from 6 ft. to 4 ft. 8½ in.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>“The foreclosure scheme of the committee” (Watkin plan), said they,
“is certainly the soundest plan and would doubtless be preferred
by those shareholders who really care for the welfare of their
property.” Then referring to the directors’ plan, “If it were
possible to present to the bondholders the scheme of proceeding by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
amicable arrangement as practicable, and therefore as presenting
a real alternative for their acceptance, we should suggest to you
at the same time to lay the option before them. We feel, however,
that that scheme can only be regarded as such an alternative when
stockholders enough have signified their willingness to vest their
shares in trustees on the footing of it, and so secure an effectual
control to the bondholders for a certain period. We must, therefore,
content ourselves for the present with suggesting that the committee
should proceed with vigor in the direction of foreclosure, at the
same time inviting the stockholders to signify their willingness to
vest their stock in trustees as above mentioned.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>The suggestion of the directors was the last alternative plan
proposed, and from April, 1876, the only question was how to perfect
and carry through the Watkin plan. As eventually put forward, this
differed in a few points from its form as earlier announced. The
fundamental principle was still the funding of coupons of the first
and second consolidated and the convertible bonds. Of these the first
consolidated mortgage and sterling 6 per cents were now to fund
<em>alternate</em> coupons from September 1, 1875, to September 1, 1879,
instead of funding <em>all</em> coupons to March 1, 1876, and receiving
cash thereafter: and whereas in the earlier plan mortgage bonds of
the same class had been given for funded interest, the later plan
created special issues of funded coupon bonds, secured by deposit
of the funded coupons, and bearing the same interest as the first
consolidated bonds themselves. A more serious difference appeared in
the treatment of the second mortgage and the gold convertibles. It
will be remembered that it had been proposed in December, 1875, to
exchange these for two classes of new bonds, of which 60 per cent
were to bear interest at the rate of 6 per cent and 40 per cent
were to consist of 4 per cent income bonds. The new plan did away
with this permanent reduction in fixed charges. Instead, the second
consolidated and convertible gold bonds funded alternate coupons
from June 1, 1875, to December 1, 1879, and received a new 6 per
cent bond for the principal of their holdings, and funded coupon 6
per cent bonds for the interest thus postponed; the new mortgage
bonds not having the right of foreclosure until after default for
six successive interest periods (3 years). The funded coupon bonds
were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span> to be funded at the existing rate of interest on the second
consolidated and convertible bonds, <i>i. e.</i> 7 per cent, so that the
reduction in interest was compensated for by the greater volume of
securities given; and both classes of these coupon bonds were to bear
lower interest at first than that to which they would ultimately
attain. The assessment proposed in 1875 was retained in 1876, except
that stockholders were given the choice of paying $6 on common and $3
on preferred stock and obtaining therefor income bonds, or of paying
$4 on common and $2 on preferred and receiving nothing but new stock,
dollar for dollar for their old.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> One-half of the shares of the
new company (after foreclosure) were to be issued in the name of one
or more sets of trustees, who were to hold them to vote on until a
dividend had been paid on the preferred stock for three consecutive
years. Provision was made for an issue of $2,500,000 in prior lien
bonds, to take precedence of the remainder of the second consols,
the proceeds to be applied to capital requirements. Voting power
was conferred on the first and second consols, funded income bonds,
prior lien bonds, and income bonds, in all about $57,000,000; one
vote to every $100 of bonds.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> The property of the company was to
be foreclosed by or under the direction of certain reconstruction
trustees, for the choice of whom careful provisions were inserted.</p>

<p>Divested of all complications, what this reorganization plan
proposed for the salvation of the property was the funding of the
coupons on four classes of bonds from 1875 to 1879; the reduction
of the interest to be paid on $25,000,000 second consolidated and
convertible 7s one per cent per share; and the raising of a certain
amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span> of cash by assessment upon the stockholders; while it dropped
the one point of the earlier plan which might have given a key to
the solution of the whole problem, viz. the exchange of mortgage
and income bonds for the old second consolidated in the ratios
respectively of 60 per cent and of 40 per cent. When we remember
the desperate straits to which the company had been reduced, the
permanent relief seems slight enough; and given the fact, which
proved but too true, that the net earnings were to fall off until the
road was little more than able to meet the alternate coupons which it
was obliged to pay in cash, it appears to have been nothing at all.
If we suppose no changes to have occurred in capital account between
1878 and 1883 save those provided for in the plan of reorganization
itself, a comparison of the two periods would have stood as follows:</p>

<p>It thus appears that this reorganization plan contemplated an
immediate increase in the cumbrous capitalization of the company to
the amount of nearly $12,000,000, and an eventual increase in fixed
charges of over $500,000. It offered no reasonable assurance that
the solvency of the company could be maintained under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span> average
conditions existing in the past, and left no margin for contingencies
of any kind. The trouble lay in the unwillingness of bondholders to
sacrifice any part of their holdings to meet difficulties caused
largely by inflation over which they had had no control. This
reluctance was natural,—it should have been met, however, by the
realization that the question was now of the future and not of the
past, and that the best interests of the bondholders themselves
demanded a reconstruction sufficiently radical to leave no doubt of
the ability of the new company to pay its debts.</p>

<p>The plan adopted, foreclosure was in order, and suits which had been
begun as early as 1875 were taken up and pushed. In November, 1877,
a decree of foreclosure under the second consolidated mortgage was
obtained, appointing a referee to conduct the sale, and providing for
the sale of the road to representatives of the bondholders in case
they made the highest bid. The opposition, which had not been able to
prevent the approval of the plan, now appeared with a multiplicity
of suits to prevent its consummation. In January, 1878, demands were
made to secure a re-accounting from the receiver, and the reopening
of an earlier suit of the people against the Erie which had been
previously discontinued. On January 18 the postponement of the sale
to March 25 was obtained. On January 19 a suit demanded the removal
of Receiver Jewett, making sweeping charges of fraud; and on January
30, in still other proceedings, Mr. Jewett was arrested on a charge
of perjury for swearing to incorrect statements in the annual report
to the state engineer;—a culmination as disgraceful as it was
absurd. In February a suit in Orange County, New York, demanded the
removal of the receiver, and the appointment of a special receiver
during the pendency of the action, with an injunction to prevent
the sale of the road. In March a petition of one Isaac Fowler, a
stockholder, for permission to examine the company’s books, was
granted; argument was heard on the petition of James McHenry to
intervene in the foreclosure suits and further to postpone the sale;
the application of Albert Betz and others to be made parties was
granted; and postponement of sale to April 24 obtained. Last of all,
on April 23 and 24, arguments in behalf of John F. Brown and F. W.
Isaacson were heard, asking for postponement to a still later date.
The litigation availed nothing. Judge Potter in the Brown suit held
that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span> the courts could relieve against any injustice occasioned
by the sale, and on April 24 the property of the Erie Railway was
sold for $6,000,000 under foreclosure of the second consolidated
mortgage.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> The new corporation formed to take over the railroad
was called the New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad Company, and
had its articles of incorporation regularly filed at the office of
the Secretary of State. Mr. Jewett was elected president. In May the
receiver was discharged,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> and a new stage in the history of the
road began.</p>

<p>For about seven years the Erie was to be free from the necessity for
further reorganization. This result, unexpected from the nature of
the adjustment of 1878, was due to the vigorous policy of Mr. Jewett,
first, in developing the coal traffic for which the Erie was well
located; second, in improving the condition of the road; and third,
in securing connections with Chicago.</p>

<p>For some time the Erie had been a considerable carrier of coal
and a large owner of coal lands as well. In 1877, the first year
in which the figures were separated in the annual report, roughly
273,000,000 out of 1,113,000,000 ton miles reported, or something
over one-quarter, were due to the carriage of coal; and $2,697,776
out of a total of $10,647,807 of the freight earnings came from
that business. The lands owned by the company consisted of 8000
acres in fee, and large tracts in leasehold and mining rights in
the anthracite territory in the northeast corner of Pennsylvania;
together with 14,000 acres in fee and 13,000 acres of mining
rights in the bituminous territory in the northwest portion of the
state.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Mr. Jewett felt that this property could be made of great
value to the road, and it was under his administration as receiver
that steps were taken to extend the holdings of bituminous land,
and to control branch roads leading into the district. The result
appeared in a remarkable extension of the company’s business. While
the total freight ton mileage from 1878 to 1884 increased 103 per
cent, the ton mileage of coal increased 190 per cent, or nearly
tripled; and while the gross earnings on ordinary freight grew from
$7,950,031 to $11,687,520, those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span> on coal increased from $2,697,776
to $5,437,000. At the same time McKean County, directly north of the
coal lands, and containing large tracts purchased by the Erie in
the course of its other negotiations, turned out to be an abundant
oil-producing district, and made the Bradford branch, which tapped
it, Erie’s most valuable collateral property.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>It was partly because of the success of the policy in respect to
coal lands that the Erie was enabled to spend large sums in the
improvement of its road. In the six years from 1878 to 1883 the
company put nearly $14,000,000 into improvements of the road,
property and equipment, and of this about one-half was paid out of
surplus earnings. In December, 1883, alone, $304,565 were spent, and
in the three succeeding months nearly double that amount; making a
total of nearly $1,000,000 in the four months previous to April,
1884. The money went toward reducing grades, straightening curves,
increasing weight of rails, etc., including the completion of a third
rail to Buffalo by which the serious disadvantage of an exceptional
gauge was removed. Its result was seen in the decrease in the ratio
of operating expenses from 75.13 in 1875 and 77.16 in 1876 to 64.78
in 1883; and in the rise of net earnings per ton mile from .251 cents
to .261 cents, while the gross earnings per ton mile decreased from
1.209 cents to .780 cents. No policy which the Erie managers pursued
met a more crying need, and none did so much toward maintaining the
solvency of the company.</p>

<p>The project of controlling a line of their own to Chicago was brought
actively to the attention of the Erie managers by the danger of
being cut off from a connection with that city. The original line
of the Erie had run to Dunkirk on Lake Erie, from which a branch
to Buffalo had soon been built. For western traffic the Erie had
had to rely largely on the Atlantic &amp; Great Western (later the New
York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio), which connected with the main line at
Salamanca, New York, and extended by 1884 west to Dayton, Ohio. In
1857 the Erie first leased this property. Placed in receivers’ hands
in 1869, the Atlantic &amp; Great Western was re-leased to the Erie on
January 1, 1870; sold July 1, 1871, it was again leased to the Erie
in May, 1874, only to enter upon a new receivership on December 9 of
that year. The persistent attempt to control the road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span> showed the
value which the Erie placed upon it, and in fact it was invaluable as
a link in a prospective line to the West. Even while the leases were
in force, however, the Erie lacked that connection of its own with
Chicago which seemed necessary to make it a successful competitor for
trunk-line business. In 1882 it was forwarding passengers over not
less than five different routes, over no one of which could it feel
assured of the continuance of contracts of a favorable nature. In
1881 Mr. Jewett relieved the situation by acquiring control of the
franchise of the Chicago &amp; Atlantic Railway, extending from Marion,
Ohio, on the line of the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio towards
Chicago, and soon after he entered into a contract with certain
private parties for construction of the road. In 1883 he executed a
new lease of the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio, which he hoped would
secure for the Erie permanent control of the property, and about the
same time (1882) he purchased a controlling interest in the stock of
the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton, which extended the Erie system
to the important city of Cincinnati. These operations put the Erie
upon a footing which was secure so long as the obligations which they
entailed could be met, and showed a broad-minded appreciation of
strategic necessities. The terms of the arrangement with the Chicago
&amp; Atlantic were as follows: For the construction of the road the Erie
agreed to give to the directors the entire proceeds of the mortgage
bonds of that branch ($6,500,000), and its entire capital stock
($10,000,000); making an aggregate of $61,710 per mile of line. The
proceeds were, however, to be deposited with the president of the New
York, Lake Erie &amp; Western in trust, together with certain subsidies
which had been voted by the counties and townships along the line,
and upon him was to devolve the duty of seeing to the proper
application thereof; and besides this, 90 per cent of the stock
was to be deposited and an irrevocable proxy given thereon for the
thirty years’ life of the bonds.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> The obligation which the Erie
assumed amounted in practice to guaranteeing that the road should
be constructed for the sum provided, and that interest on the bonds
should be paid. In leasing the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio the Erie
involved itself more heavily. As lessee it agreed to pay the minimum
sum of $1,757,055 yearly (the net earnings of 1882); the actual
rental to be 32 per cent of all gross earnings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span> up to $6,000,000
and 50 per cent of all gross earnings above $6,000,000, until the
average of the whole rental should be raised to 35 per cent, or
until the gross earnings should be $7,200,000. If 32 per cent of the
gross earnings should ever be less than the $1,757,055 to be paid
yearly, then the deficiency was to be made up, without interest,
out of the excess in any subsequent year. Out of the rental the New
York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio was to pay the interest on its prior lien
bonds, the rentals of its leased lines, the expenses of maintaining
its organization in Europe and America, and for five years a sum of
$260,000 each year to the car trust.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Finally, in purchasing the
Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton, the Erie gave to the holders of the
$2,000,000 of stock which it bought beneficial certificates to the
amount of $1,500,000, on which it agreed to make good any failure of
the Cincinnati company to pay 6 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>But though the Erie managers did their best with the conditions which
they were called upon to face, they were unable to hold the company
up under the enormous capitalization and heavy charges left by the
reorganization of 1874–8, at a time when rate wars were sapping its
resources, and when contracts which it was being forced to make
were entailing an annual loss.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> In spite of the declaration of
sufficient dividends on the comparatively small amount of preferred
stock to terminate the voting trust, it is certain that for most of
the years from 1874 to 1884 the solvency of the road was a precarious
matter, and that there never was a time when any considerable falling
off in earnings or any severe shock to its credit would not have
driven it to the wall.</p>

<p>Such a shock was preparing in the early months of 1884. For some
weeks before the last of April there had been a tendency for the
quotations of Erie securities to fall; no reason was assigned, but
it was hinted that default might be made in the payment of the June
interest on the second consols, and that a receivership was not
unlikely. This weakness was accompanied, and perhaps accentuated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
by a strike of the brakemen on the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio in
consequence of an order reducing the number of brakemen on each train
from three to two. The truth of the matter came out in May, when the
failure of the Wall Street firm of Grant &amp; Ward both precipitated a
stock exchange panic and laid bare the straits to which the company
had been reduced. Investigation showed that a large floating debt had
been piling up for four principal purposes: First, advances to the
Chicago &amp; Atlantic Railroad; second, advances for coal mines; third,
advances for improvements on the Hudson River at Weehawken; fourth,
equipment instalments.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Attempts to raise funds to cover the debt
had resulted in the negotiation of promissory short time notes with
the firm of Grant &amp; Ward, for which $2,500,000 of Chicago &amp; Atlantic
second mortgage bonds had been deposited as security. The company
had been attracted to Grant &amp; Ward by their offer to purchase and
dispose of Chicago &amp; Atlantic bonds at a price 15 per cent above that
offered by any other parties;<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> and had trusted so implicitly in
their integrity as to deposit notes and collateral for its short time
loans detached and independent, one from the other, so that Grant &amp;
Ward were able to, and did, fraudulently raise money upon them to
an amount much larger than the advances they had made. The losses
entailed by the transaction were serious, and the blow to Erie’s
credit was even more severe. The floating debt which had been so hard
to carry became doubly menacing now that the possibility of further
short time loans was practically cut off; and to cap the climax, the
earnings for the first half of the year 1884 showed an unusually
large decrease with the cessation of the fall business. Under these
circumstances it was the part of wisdom to take advantage of every
loophole of escape, and the peculiar provisions of the second
consolidated mortgage, denying to these bonds the right of immediate
foreclosure in case of default, were turned to for relief. It will be
remembered that by the terms of the reorganization of 1878 no right
of action was to accrue to the second mortgage bondholders until
on each of six successive due dates of coupons (three years) some
interest secured by the second indenture should be in default. This
being the case the Erie directors decided to pass the June interest
on these bonds. “As a general rule,” said they in a circular, “the
business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span> and earnings of the company are much less for the first
half than for the last half of the year. The falling off in earnings
for the first six months of the previous year has been unusually
large. The coupons of the second consolidated mortgage bonds are
due and payable on the first of June prox.... Under ordinary
circumstances the board might at the present as on the former
occasions provide to some extent for the deficit of the first six
months, relying on the usual increase in earnings of the last half
of the year, but in the present depressed condition of the business
of the country and of the earnings of this company, as well as of
others, the board does not feel at liberty to deal with anything but
the business and earnings as now ascertained, and therefore deems it
wise to accept the provisions of the mortgage as the lawful rule for
their government in the existing emergency....”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>However necessary the action, the bondholders of the company could
not have been expected to receive it quietly; and naturally again,
the indignation was intense among the English securityholders,
to whom, more than to any one else, the existing situation was
due. In June, 1884, a meeting of stockholders of the company was
held in London, at which much complaint was made of the fall in
value of the securities of the company, and an inquiry into the
management was demanded. A committee was appointed, and two of its
members, Messrs. Powell and Westlake, landed in New York July 15,
with protestations of a friendly spirit toward all concerned. The
situation was not encouraging. The day before their arrival President
Jewett had offered his resignation, and the directors were busy
selecting his successor; a large floating debt was demanding most
vigorous attention, and confidence in the company was at a low ebb.
Beyond a doubt the raising of a large amount of cash, $4,000,000 to
$5,000,000, was a pressing necessity, and the English representatives
were anxious to make it plain that at least a fair share of this
should come from American as well as from English bondholders.
Force of circumstances compelled them to give assurance that the
money would be raised, and this done, Mr. John King accepted the
position which Mr. Jewett professed himself ready to resign. Pending
the annual election Mr. King took the position of Assistant to the
President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
On their return to London Messrs. Powell and Westlake reported the
floating debt to be as follows:</p>

<table summary="floating debt">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Unpaid coupons, June 1, 1884,</td>
    <td class="tdr">$1,007,922</td>

    <td class="tdr">$4,447,316</td>
    <td> </td></tr>
</table>

<p>“All the purposes, the expenditures on which have caused the floating
debt,” said they, “seem to us to have been in themselves wise and
politic, but the piling up of a large floating debt for even the
best of purposes is always more or less imprudent and dangerous.
The company’s credit might have borne the strain of the panic, but
it was broken down by the Grant &amp; Ward disaster, and the funding of
its floating debt is now indispensable.... We have suggested to the
president and directors, and now recommend to the committee that an
effort should be made without delay to raise a permanent loan on the
securities available for a total of $5,000,000.”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> This, it will
be observed, was the old remedy. Inability to meet current expenses
was to be removed by capitalizing the debts which this inability had
caused.</p>

<p>The year 1885 was taken up with suits brought against the Erie by
certain of its branch lines. In February the directors of the Buffalo
&amp; Southwestern Company brought suit to recover $345,000 interest
defaulted during the previous January. The complaint alleged that the
Erie was insolvent, and asked that it be restrained from using the
gross receipts of the road until the default should have been made
good. The Erie paid the back interest, but in July, after another
default, an injunction was obtained forbidding it to divert any
part of the earnings received or to be received from this property.
It was recited that on May 24, 1881, the Buffalo &amp; Southwestern
had been leased to the Erie for 35 per cent of the gross earnings,
subject to certain deductions; that the Erie had delayed payment of
the rental due in January, 1885, and had refused to pay that due in
July, 1885, but that it was still receiving the gross earnings of the
plaintiffs’ road, and had applied these to the payment of its debts
other than the rentals of this road.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> In November, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span> the
Erie’s other troubles were settled, the litigation was terminated
by an agreement to reduce the Buffalo &amp; Southwestern rental from 35
per cent to 27½ per cent. Other suits arose, directly or indirectly,
because of the control which Mr. Jewett maintained as trustee of the
stock of the Chicago &amp; Atlantic and the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton
railways even after his resignation from the Erie Company. On the
one hand President King was anxious to repossess himself of these
important branches for the Erie, and on the other Mr. Jewett was
not disinclined to do what damage he could to the managers who had
succeeded in supplanting him. In the matter of the Chicago &amp; Atlantic
Mr. Jewett gained the first victory in a temporary injunction
forbidding the Erie to divert traffic from this line contrary to
contract. This injunction was soon, however, substantially vacated,
and President King in his turn obtained a decision that Jewett had
been made trustee of the Chicago &amp; Atlantic simply because he had
been at the time vice-president of the New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western
Railroad Company and could be relied upon to control the road as the
western outlet of the Erie. A receiver was subsequently appointed
and the road reorganized as the Chicago &amp; Erie Railroad Company, the
Erie agreeing to guarantee payment of its first mortgage bonds, and
receiving in return the $100,000 of capital stock and $5,000,000 in
income bonds, besides $2,000,000 first mortgage bonds which were
in part payment of old advances.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> In his action concerning the
Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton President King was less successful; and
Mr. Jewett was sustained in his refusal to deliver proxies for the
stock held to the larger company. The result was to turn the Erie
to the Big Four, upon which, instead of upon the Dayton road, the
management was for some time to rely for an entrance into Cincinnati.</p>

<p>During these various contests the suggestions of the English
committee were not lost to view, and in the latter part of 1885 they
crystallized into definite propositions. The floating debt then
consisted of two parts: first, the defaulted coupons on the second
consolidated bonds; and second, the current liabilities accumulated
for the purposes before described. The relief proposed was likewise
in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span> two parts, and involved the issue of a 5 per cent mortgage,
secured by deposit of the second consolidated coupons maturing and to
mature in June and December, 1884, June, 1885, and June, 1886, and
a 6 per cent mortgage upon the property of the Long Dock Company,
comprising the valuable terminals of the Erie at Jersey City.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
The funding of the coupon issue proved simplicity itself; the funded
coupons were exchanged for bonds of the new gold mortgage, which
were to be redeemable at 105 at the pleasure of the company.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
By the end of 1886 these bonds had been accepted by the holders of
$32,982,500 of the outstanding $33,597,400 of the second consols,
and $3,957,900 of them had been issued. Dealing with the Long Dock
Company was slightly complicated by the fact that 8000 shares of
that company were pledged as part security for the issue of Erie
collateral bonds. To free them $800,000 in cash were deposited
with the trustee of the mortgage, which were in turn employed by
him to pay off $727,000 of the 6 per cent collateral bonds, thus
reducing the interest charge on that issue $43,620 per annum. This
done, the Long Dock Company extended the lease of its property and
franchises to the Erie to 1935 at a rental of $480,000 per annum, and
contemporaneously therewith placed a consolidated mortgage upon its
property to secure $7,500,000 of 50-year 6 per cent gold bonds; of
which $3,000,000 were reserved to retire existing indebtedness, and
the proceeds of $4,500,000 were paid to the Erie for the cancellation
of its floating debt. The total result was to increase fixed charges
by $270,000 of interest at 6 per cent on the Long Dock bonds, and
by $197,895 on $3,957,900 of the new funded 5s, less the reduction
of $43,620 on cancelled collateral bonds; leaving a net increase of
$424,275.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> For its ingenuity the scheme was to be admired; from
any other point of view it was to be condemned as another example
of that borrowing to pay interest which had brought the Erie to its
existing straits. The incapacity of the creditors of the company to
realize that continued borrowing of money to pay current obligations
was only to ensure repeated bankruptcy seemed complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
After this new “salvation,” the Erie started once more on its
laborious attempt to pay interest on its outstanding bonds. From 1887
to 1892 the business increased somewhat, and despite a decrease in
the average receipts per ton mile<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> a gain of about $4,700,000 in
gross earnings was secured; from which is to be deducted an increase
of $310,996 in fixed charges, and of $4,076,111 in operating expenses.</p>

<p>The prohibition of pooling in 1887 affected the company unfavorably.
Previous to the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act the other
lines had been paying it an annual average of $42,500 on west-bound
business from New York for shortages under the operation of the
trunk-line pool, besides about $88,000 annually on east-bound dead
freight and $19,770 on live stock. These payments ceased when the
Act was passed, although a differential on west-bound traffic was
subsequently allowed.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> But the leakage which was most apparent
lay in the large rental and heavy operating cost of the New York,
Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio. It will be remembered that the Erie had leased
that road for 32 per cent of the gross earnings when earnings were
$6,000,000 or under, and 50 per cent when they should be above that
figure. In 1887 this was amended so as to provide that for every
increase of $100,000 over $6,000,000 in the gross earnings the Erie
should pay to the lessor an additional one-tenth of one per cent of
such gross earnings until the gross earnings should be $7,250,000,
and the rental 33½ per cent, after which the percentage was not to
increase.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> Under the old lease the Erie had guaranteed to carry
over the line 50 per cent of all its east-bound and 65 per cent of
all its west-bound through traffic—under the new lease, these maxima
were increased to 55 per cent and 70 per cent; but even this failed
to make the branch road pay. Its grades were high, its equipment and
sidings were limited, its cost of operation was well above 68 per
cent; and the increase in tonnage provided for emphasized each and
every disadvantage. Up to 1893 the results of operations were as
follows:</p>

<p>It thus appears that the terms of the amended lease were in reality
more onerous than the contract which they succeeded, and that
whatever the value of the branch as a feeder, its operation involved
large and fairly regular deductions from the net income of the parent
line. Emphasis on these facts was laid in the annual reports, and
frequent demands were made that the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio
bring its road up to the standard of like connections of through
trunk lines. Meanwhile improvements were imperative on the Erie’s
own lines: new equipment was needed, new rails and new motive power,
and at the same time surplus earnings were somewhat less. The
directors adopted the expedient of allowing current liabilities to
accumulate, and put $8,496,572 into the road from October 1, 1884, to
September 30, 1892, of which $3,351,977 represented surplus earnings,
$2,375,400 increase in bonded indebtedness, and the balance floating
debt. In the matter of traffic policy they paid particular attention
to the coal business, which, however, lost ground as compared with
other freight, and to the local business, which it was the policy of
the management to encourage. In 1890 the board declared that “the
time had arrived when extraordinary expenditure for improvements and
the necessities of the property were no longer necessary.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> In
1891 3 per cent on the preferred stock was paid, the first dividend
since 1884.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>From 1887 to 1893, with all its struggles, the Erie was continually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
on the verge of failure. The capitalization in 1892 was at the
enormous total of $163,607,485 on an operated mileage of 1698 miles,
while fixed charges were $4993 per mile, and the available net
revenue but $4830.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Given, with this condition, a gross floating
debt which amounted in 1892 to $9,163,166, and represented in a large
measure the inability of the company to make necessary repairs, no
further explanation is needed for the bankruptcy which soon took
place.</p>

<p>Early in 1893 rumors were current that the Erie might be thrown
into the hands of a receiver. The reports were vigorously denied,
but on July 25, nevertheless, on application of the company itself,
Judge Lacombe appointed President John King and Mr. J. G. McCullough
as receivers of the property. The measure was taken to avoid the
sacrifice of collaterals deposited. “Within the last few weeks,” said
President King, “during the severe money stringency the floating
debt of the Erie ... became impossible of renewal, and in order
not to sacrifice the best interests of the company it was decided
to place the road in receivers’ hands, and preserve the system
intact, and preserve and develop the transportation business for
the company.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> The action occasioned no surprise, and there was
even a disposition to praise the management for having preserved
the solvency of the company. “The company was bankrupt <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i>
when it passed to its new control,” says Mott, and “that the time
when it must become bankrupt <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de jure</i> was held off so long was a
striking demonstration of the tact and resourcefulness which the
new <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i> had been able to bring to bear in the management of
the company’s unpromising affairs, and in judicious shifting and
manipulating of the heavy burdens Erie bore upon its chafed and weary
shoulders.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> What a receivership meant was a new opportunity
to put the company upon a genuinely sound foundation, by providing
new capital to pay off the floating debt and to allow for future
additions and improvements, and by getting fixed charges to a point
well within the road’s capacity to earn. We shall see what use was
made of the chance.</p>

<p>The matter of reorganization was set about at once. On January
1 a plan appeared, prepared, at least nominally, by a special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
committee chosen by the directors,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> and backed by the well-known
firms of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. of New York and J. S. Morgan &amp; Co.
of London.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> By its terms no mortgage senior to the second
consolidated mortgage was to be disturbed save the first mortgage,
which matured in 1897. The bonds to be dealt with were thus reduced
to $41,481,048, besides which provision had to be made for the
floating debt and for future capital requirements. The plan proposed
to authorize a blanket mortgage of $70,000,000 at 5 per cent, of
which $33,597,000 were to exchange at par for the 6 per cent second
consolidated bonds and funded coupons thereof, $4,031,400 to exchange
for the funded coupon bonds of 1885, and $508,008 for the income
bonds. Of the balance, $6,512,800 were to be reserved to settle
with the old first lien and collateral trust bonds, $15,915,208 to
supply capital requirements in the future, and $9,915,208 to be
offered for subscription in order to pay the floating debt. The new
management did not conceive that these last bonds could be sold to
advantage in the general market, but imposed as a condition of the
exchanges as above that second consols, funded coupon, and income
bonds should subscribe at 90 to the extent of 25 per cent of their
holdings; hoping that the grant of the right of immediate foreclosure
upon default would induce the second consols to come in. Both these
consols and the funded coupon bonds of 1885, it may be remarked, were
to be kept alive and deposited with the trustee for the protection of
the new bonds. Stated in tabular form the distribution of securities
was to be as follows:</p>

<p>The new mortgage was to cover the property of the New York, Lake Erie
&amp; Western, including its leasehold of the New York, Pennsylvania &amp;
Ohio, and the capital stock of the Chicago &amp; Erie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span> Railroad.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
There was to be no assessment, no syndicate to raise money, and no
voting trust.</p>

<p>This plan was advanced as adequate to restore the prosperity of
the company. Examination will show its weakness. It comprised two
measures of relief: first, reduction of interest by one per cent on
the second consolidated bonds; second, the settlement of the floating
debt. The first might be thought to have been the kernel of the plan,
and the reduction in fixed charges the principal thing aimed at. That
it was not is shown by the fact that so liberal were the new bond
issues that the total fixed charges after reorganization were to
be greater than those before. The floating debt which remained had
arisen from lack of funds with which to make current and necessary
improvements and repairs. This debt was the immediate cause of the
failure of the company, and its cancellation was the real purpose of
the plan. The method proposed was a forced levy upon bondholders,
but the levy took, not the form of an assessment, but that of a
subscription to new bonds on which payment of interest was to be as
obligatory as any other charge. The operation differed, therefore,
from an ordinary sale of securities in the more favorable selling
price which it assured. It did little, however, to lighten the burden
which had crushed the company. The only bright spot in the plan was
the provision for future construction and improvement, which, though
involving a still further increase in indebtedness, was justified
because these improvements would serve not only to maintain but to
make greater the earning powers of the company. Finally, it was
the peculiar effect of this plan that it put the pressure imposed
upon the wrong parties: the second consolidated and other junior
bondholders were to be forced to subscribe to the new issue, when in
fact it was the stockholders who should have been turned to, and whom
it was consonant with no sound principle of finance to spare. Other
matters come out in the objections raised by bondholders.</p>

<p>Opposition to the plan was vigorously headed by men like Kuhn, Loeb &amp;
Co., E. H. Harriman, August Belmont, Hallgarten, Peabody, Vermilye,
and others.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> In England a meeting of dissentients was held and a
committee was elected;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> in America the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span> formal action was
the dispatch of a letter to the Erie managers by opposing bankers
which is important enough to be quoted in full.</p>

<p>“Consultations and comparisons of views have recently taken place,”
said these gentlemen, “between the owners and representatives of the
second consolidated mortgage bonds and other bonds of your company,
to whom the proposition as detailed in your circular of January
2 is not satisfactory.... Your plan seems unjust, inasmuch as it
demands a permanent reduction of interest on the bonded indebtedness
for which no adequate equivalent is offered, and it levies a
forced contribution upon the bondholders through the demand for a
subscription to new bonds at a price considerably over and above the
market value these new bonds are likely to command, while the fixed
charges proposed to be created appear to be considerably larger than,
in the light of past earnings and experience, the property of the
company can carry with safety.</p>

<p>“Instead of 5 per cent bonds, as provided in the published plan,
4 per cent bonds, in our opinion, should be issued, while for
the interest to be surrendered the bondholders should receive an
equivalent in interminable non-cumulative 4 per cent debentures,
interest payable if earned; the holders of the debentures to have
sufficient representation in the management to protect them.</p>

<p>“The floating debt should be liquidated from the proceeds of
an adequate amount of new 4 per cent bonds (and debentures if
desirable), which shall be offered to the shareholders and
bondholders at a price rather below than above the probable
market value of the new securities, and under the guarantee of an
underwriting syndicate.</p>

<p>“Provision should also be made to obtain the conversion on fair
terms of the reorganization prior lien bonds into the new bonds,
so that it shall become practicable to secure the new 4 per cent
bonds at once by a lien second only to the ‘Erie first consolidated
7 per cent bonds’; the new 4 per cent bonds to be issued under a
general mortgage to an amount sufficient to provide for future
additions and improvements, and with adequate provision for the
taking up of the underlying bonds, and the issue of 4 per cent bonds
in their stead.... Any plan now adopted for the readjustment of
the finances of your company should seek, as its first object, to
reduce the permanent charges so well within the earning capacity
of the property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span> as to make another default in the future an
improbability.... We trust this communication will be received in the
spirit in which it is submitted.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>The directors refused to modify their plan, and the bankers,
therefore, notified them of the election of a protective
committee.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> On March 6 a meeting of stockholders approved the
plan, and the same week Messrs. Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. gave notice
that, having received deposits of a majority of each class of bonds,
they had declared the plan operative as announced.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>Defeated in their appeal to the securityholders, the opposition
turned to the courts. As a preliminary, they obtained an opinion
from the well-known firm of Messrs. Evarts, Choate &amp; Beaman, which
held, first, that the Erie could not legally pay interest on the new
bonds proposed until it had paid the interest on every one of the old
second mortgage bonds, regardless of whether the latter was deposited
with the reorganization committee; second, that if the old second
mortgage bonds which were deposited as security for the new issue
should be kept alive as proposed, the company would be increasing
its obligations beyond the legal limit;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> and third, that much of
the stock voted at the special meeting at which the new mortgage had
been authorized was not really owned by the persons who had issued
the proxies thereon as the law provided.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Following the opinion,
suit was commenced by Mr. Harriman in April for an injunction against
the recording of the new mortgage, on the ground that the Drexel &amp;
Morgan proxies did not represent the actual stockholders, and in June
by one John J. Emery to prevent the execution of the mortgage. Judge
Ingraham in the Supreme Court Chambers denied an injunction, using
in his opinion the following language: “While it is clear,” said he,
“that there are certain obligations resting upon the majority to
refrain from infringing the legal right of the minority, and that a
court of equity will enforce and protect the rights of the minority,
still, when the holder of a very small number of bonds or shares of
stock seeks to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span> enjoin a very large majority from carrying out a plan
such majority deem to be for their benefit, I think the court should
not interfere unless it plainly appears that some legal right of the
minority is endangered.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>What could not be accomplished by the hostile bankers was
nevertheless to happen from the inherent weakness of the plan itself.
It has been said that the new scheme involved an increase instead
of a decrease in fixed charges. How this was to be met was not
demonstrated; and already in June, 1894, it was necessary to announce
that the coupons then due would not be paid for the present. In
December matters were even worse, and a circular from Drexel, Morgan
&amp; Co. confessed the company’s inability to meet the coupons maturing.
“Nevertheless,” the firm continued, “it seems to us inexpedient to
treat the inability of the company to pay interest as an occasion for
present foreclosure without giving a further chance to the company,
especially as payment of bondholders’ subscriptions to the new bonds
has not yet been called to provide the company with money necessary
to pay the floating debt. It is, therefore, now proposed that the new
bonds be issued with the coupons of June 1, 1894, and December, 1894,
attached, but stamped as subject to a contract with the company which
shall provide that they shall be paid as soon as practical out of the
first net earnings over and above the railroad company’s requirements
to meet interest and rentals accruing after December 1, 1894, except
in case a default on later coupons shall give power of foreclosure,
in which event the stamped coupons shall retain all their original
rights.” The modification was assented to,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> but could not save
the plan. Reluctantly the managers were forced to abandon it, and to
consent to more radical propositions.</p>

<p>August 26, 1895, the new and final reorganization plan appeared.
There were to be issued:</p>

<div id="list66" class="p1 in2">
<p>$175,000,000 first consolidated mortgage 100-year gold bonds;</p>
<p>  30,000,000 first preferred 4 per cent non-cumulative stock;</p>
<p>  16,000,000 second preferred 4 per cent non-cumulative stock;</p>
<p> 100,000,000 common stock.</p>
</div>

<p>The first consolidated mortgage bonds were to be divided into prior
lien bonds to the amount of $35,000,000, and general lien<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span> bonds
to the amount of $140,000,000; the former to have priority of lien
over the latter for both principal and interest. Both classes of
bonds were to be secured by mortgage and pledge of all railroads and
properties of every kind embraced in the reorganization as carried
out and vested in the new company, and also all other properties
which should be acquired thereafter by issue of any of the new bonds.
Both issues were to bear interest at 4 per cent, except $29,435,000
of the general lien bonds, which were to bear 3 per cent for two
years from July 1, 1896, and 4 per cent thereafter. The stock was to
rank for dividends in the order given. Provision was made that no
additional mortgage could be put upon the property to be acquired,
and that no additional issue of first preferred stock could be made
except with the consent in each instance of the holders of a majority
of the whole amount of each class of preferred stock, given at a
meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose; and with the
consent of the stockholders of a majority of such part of the common
stock as should be represented at such meeting, the holders of each
class of stock voting separately; also that the amount of second
preferred stock could not be increased except with like consent of
the holders of a majority thereof, and a majority of such part of the
common stock as should be represented at the meeting. All classes of
stock were to be deposited in a voting trust until December 1, 1900,
and until the expiration of such further period, if any, as should
elapse before the Erie should in one year have paid 4 per cent cash
dividends on the first preferred stock; though the voting trustees
might terminate the trust earlier at their discretion.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the prior lien bonds were relied on to pay the
floating debt, to buy in the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio, and to
retire certain prior liens of the old company. The general lien bonds
were reserved for undisturbed bonds, and, with the first preferred
stock, exchanged for junior New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western securities.
The second preferred stock went for old preferred stock and income
bonds, and the new common stock exchanged for old common.</p>

<p>The distribution was as follows: The old New York, Lake Erie &amp;
Western reorganization first lien and collateral bonds were paid off
from the proceeds of the new prior lien bonds; the second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span> consols
received 75 per cent in new general lien bonds and 55 per cent in
preferred stock; the funded coupon bonds of 1885 received 100 per
cent in general lien bonds, 10 per cent in first preferred, and 10
per cent in second preferred stock; the income bonds 40 per cent
in general liens and 60 per cent in first preferred stock; the New
York, Lake Erie &amp; Western preferred stock, on payment of assessment,
100 per cent in new common. For all other bonds included in the plan
there were reserved general lien bonds in amounts usually equal to
the par of the securities to be retired.</p>

<p>The cash requirements and the floating debt were as follows:</p>

<p>The necessity for retirement of the first lien and collateral bonds
arose from the early maturity of the former, and from the fact that
stocks and bonds of various Erie properties which it was desirous to
consolidate with the new company were pledged for the latter. The
wisdom of allowing for early construction and expenditure could not
be denied; car trust payments were required to preserve the rolling
stock, and the floating debt and receivers’ certificates called
obviously for cash. Provision was made, first, by an assessment on
the stock of $8 on preferred and $12 on common, with higher payments
in case of delay, and estimated to yield $10,023,368; second, by a
contribution from the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio of $742,320;
and third, by the sale of $15,000,000 prior lien bonds as indicated
above. A syndicate of $25,000,000 was formed to subscribe to the
prior liens, and to take the place of and succeed to all the rights
of stockholders who should not deposit their stock and pay the
assessment thereon.</p>

<p>With the settlement of cash requirements, unification of the Erie
system was assured; “subject only to the undisturbed bonds and stock
until retired by use of the bonds reserved for that purpose or the
rentals corresponding thereto.” “The new bonds and stock will,” said
the plan, “represent the ownership (either in fee or in possession of
securities) approximately of:</p>

acres of bituminous, held under mining rights ... also the Union
Steamboat Company, with its terminals and other properties in
Buffalo, and its fleet of five lake steamers on which the Erie mainly
depends for the lake and railway traffic,” etc.</p>

<p>Fixed charges under the plan were estimated at $7,850,000. Fixed
charges in 1894 had been $9,400,000. For the first two years after
reorganization, moreover, the charges were to be further reduced by
$300,000 per annum, as the new general lien bonds were to bear only
3 per cent interest during that period; and an additional saving of
$1,000,000 was looked for when the exchange of old bonds for new on
the maturity of its existing prior issues should have been eventually
completed. This sum of $7,850,000 the company was expected to have
no difficulty in earning in view of the immediate expenditure of
$5,337,208 for new construction, additions, and betterments, and the
gradual distribution of the proceeds of $17,000,000 of general lien
bonds to the same end. The compensation to Messrs. J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.
and Messrs. J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. for their services as depositaries,
and in carrying out the plan was put at $500,000 and expenses.
Foreclosure was finally to take place and a new company was to be
organized.</p>

<p>This plan differed from its abandoned predecessors in four important
particulars, each of which was in its favor:</p>

<p>(1) It employed bonds and stock instead of bonds alone;</p>

<p>(2) It lowered instead of increased fixed charges;</p>

<p>(3) It procured cash from stockholders instead of from second
consolidated mortgage bondholders; and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
(4) It absorbed the New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio into the Erie
system instead of continuing the lease thereof.</p>

<p>In the employment of bonds and stock instead of a simple issue of
bonds, the Erie managers adopted what experience has shown to be
the best method of dealing with the complicated situation arising
from a great railroad default. The use of securities on which return
was optional side by side with those on which return was obligatory
tended both to protect the railroad company when earnings were low,
and to benefit the recipients of the new securities when earnings
were high. As worked out, it gave to the second consols and funded
coupons a less return in the one case, and an equal or greater return
in the other, than did the plan of 1894, and to the income bonds,
though it offered no chance of equal gain, it at least promised a
minimum below which payments should not fall. It further made a far
nicer recognition of the relative priorities of different classes of
old bonds possible, and whereas the previous plan had made the same
demands on, and had given the same return to the second consols,
the funded coupon bonds of 1885, and the income bonds, the new plan
gave, as has been pointed out, to the first 75 percent in general
lien bonds and 55 per cent in first preferred stock; to the second,
100 per cent in general lien bonds, 10 per cent in first preferred,
and 10 per cent in second preferred; and to the third, 40 per cent
in general liens and 60 per cent in first preferred stock. Income,
coupon, and consolidated bonds benefited alike from the assessment
upon the stock, which laid the burden of raising cash upon the owners
of the road, where it most properly fell. No species of security
was given for the assessment, not even common stock, with which
the managers might well have been generous; although it must be
remembered that the sale of $15,000,000 prior lien bonds for cash
was part of the reorganization plan. It may be remarked that since,
on July 2, 1895, the common stock was being offered at 10⅝, with no
sales, and the preferred at 22½, and since the chance for dividends
which the new stock was to enjoy was most remote, it was perhaps
well that the syndicate guarantee of the payment of assessments
had been obtained. Fixed charges by the new plan were lower, as
a result of the liberal use of stock in the exchanges and the
cancellation of floating debt as above; while the terms under which
the outstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span> New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio bonds were retired
were the most drastic part of the scheme. In all, the total mortgage
indebtedness of the Erie Company and its leased or controlled lines
of $234,680,180 for January, 1896, was reduced to $137,704,100 by
June 30 of that year.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>A weak point in the plan was, nevertheless, the small reduction in
bonded indebtedness which it occasioned. Although, to repeat, the
bonded indebtedness of the system was reduced from $234,680,180 to
$137,704,100, the shrinkage was more apparent than real, since it
consisted chiefly in the exchange of stock for New York, Pennsylvania
&amp; Ohio mortgage bonds, on which interest had not been paid by the
Erie, and but seldom by the New York, Pennsylvania, &amp; Ohio itself.
These securities were slashed in most drastic fashion, particularly
such of them as were inferior to the first mortgage. The amount of
the reduction in the volume outstanding is indicated by the fact
that for $5000 first mortgage New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio bonds
were given $1000 Erie prior lien bonds, $500 Erie first preferred,
$100 Erie second preferred, and $750 Erie common stock; and for
$500 second mortgage, or for $1000 third mortgage, were given $100
Erie common stock. If, now, we exclude the New York, Pennsylvania
&amp; Ohio bonds from our consideration of the funded debt, we find
the indebtedness of the Erie system on January 1, 1896, excluding
the non-assumed New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio bonds to have been
$121,399,431; and on June 30, excluding the new prior lien bonds
used to exchange for these securities, to have been $123,304,100; or
an increase through the reorganization of $1,904,669.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> Further,
there was an accompanying increase in the capital stock of the
combined companies, which did not, of course, involve an increase
in fixed charges, but which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span> increased the volume of securities
outstanding.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> What the reduction in the capital of the New York,
Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio, joined with its amalgamation with the Erie
system, did do was to lessen the burdens of that line to the parent
company. For many years the Erie had engaged to operate the branch
for 68 per cent and had paid 32 per cent of its gross earnings to the
New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio, to be applied to payment or partial
payment of interest on the excessive issues which were now retired.
It was probably to be long before an operating ratio of 68 per cent
could be successfully maintained; but the Erie after reorganization
was obliged to turn over, not 32 per cent of gross earnings, but 4
per cent on the $14,400,000 prior lien bonds which had been given for
New York, Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio securities, or an amount of $576,000;
which amounted to a reduction of the minimum rental of more than
one-half, and of the sums actually paid of almost three-quarters.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>Turning again to fixed charges, we find them estimated, after
the first two years, at $7,850,000. The average net earnings for
the period 1887–94 had been $9,331,250. These earnings will not
serve strictly as a basis for calculation, for from 1887 to 1892
they include an average of perhaps $750,000 derived from Lehigh
Valley trackage payments and other sums now discontinued. With the
deduction, therefore, of this amount from the net earnings of the
period named, the average is reduced to $8,768,750; or $918,750 more
than it was thought fixed charges would be. When it is considered
that this $918,750 represented the sum available for dividends
on $146,000,000 of outstanding Erie stock, it is plain that the
over-capitalization of the company in 1895 was still very great.</p>

<p>With these comments it is necessary to leave the plan. It was far
the best that had ever been applied to the rehabilitation of Erie’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
affairs; it was discriminating in its nature, and, thanks to the
increasing prosperity of the last eleven years, it has been fortunate
in its results. In August, 1895, a decree of foreclosure was signed
in the city of New York, and the following November the property was
sold under the second consolidated mortgage, and purchased by the
reorganization committee for $20,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>Since 1895 the Erie has shared in the prosperity of the country.
Its ton mileage has increased from 3,939,679,175 in 1897 to
6,275,629,877 in 1907; its gross earnings have grown from $31,497,031
to $53,914,827; and its net earnings, which had hovered for so many
years near or below the level of fixed charges, have now soared away
above. Under these circumstances it is but natural that large sums
should have been applied to improvements. Between December 1, 1895,
and June 30, 1907, $12,732,486 were spent in the purchase of land,
in yards, stations, and buildings, in reducing grades, relocating
tracks, and in other ways, and charged to capital; $36,511,046 were
spent for new equipment, and charged to capital; and $8,625,307 were
taken from income for equipment and improvements of various sorts.
These expenditures have had a most gratifying result. The average
train load has grown from 224.74 tons in 1895 to 471.67 in 1907,
although coal now constitutes a smaller proportion of the freight;
and the average revenue per train mile has more than doubled, in
face of a revenue per ton mile which has only slightly increased. In
1907 the Erie’s ton mileage was 59 per cent greater than in 1897,
and its passenger mileage was 73 per cent greater, but the expense
of conducting transportation had increased but 27 per cent. Instead
of freight cars with an average capacity of 22½ tons the company now
uses cars which average 34 tons. Instead of locomotives which on the
average could exert a tractive force of only 24,500 pounds as late as
1901, it has now engines which average 31,000. Freight train mileage
is 2,600,000 less than it was in 1896, and passenger train mileage
has only slightly increased.</p>

<p>And yet, with all this prosperity, it cannot be said that the Erie
enjoys an assured position. In 1907 it had to pay out 89 per cent of
the largest income which it had ever received for operating expenses,
fixed charges, and taxes. Of its net income of about $6,000,000
the modest dividends of 4 per cent on its first and second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
preferred stock absorb some $2,500,000, and the widespread financial
difficulties of 1907 have led its management to declare the dividends
for that year payable in scrip and not in cash. And although the
present period of reaction dates back but a little way the company
has been already obliged to the issue of short term notes.</p>

<p>In matters of railroad policy the Erie has accordingly been
conservative. In 1898 it acquired control of the New York,
Susquehanna &amp; Western, from New York City to Wilkesbarre in northeast
Pennsylvania. Three years later it bought the entire stock of the
Pennsylvania Coal Company in order to protect its tonnage, and, as
the directors expressed it, for other reasons which seemed good; and
in 1901 also it bought an interest in the Lehigh Valley. The most
sensational episode which has occurred has been the purchase and
subsequent release of the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton. It seems
that in 1905 Mr. J. P. Morgan bought a majority of a syndicate’s
holdings in Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton stock, amounting to a
majority of the total issue; a purchase which carried control of
the Pere Marquette and of the Chicago, Cincinnati &amp; Louisville, or
of a total system of 3675 miles. This stock Mr. Morgan turned over
to the Erie at a price reported to be $160 a share. From a traffic
point of view the deal seemed likely to strengthen the Erie’s
position in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, while more than doubling the
mileage of its system. Because of the financial condition of the new
companies, however, the purchase was decidedly unwise; and, after an
investigation, Mr. Morgan’s offer to take the road off the Erie’s
hands was gladly accepted. On December 4, 1905, Mr. Judson Harmon was
appointed receiver of the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton and of the
Pere Marquette, and the reorganization of these properties is just
being completed.</p>

<p>At present the Erie is operating 2169 miles of road as against 2166
in 1896. Its earnings have greatly increased, its capitalization has
grown in less proportion,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> but it has not yet a sufficient margin
of surplus earnings to meet a decline in prosperity without serious
misgivings. Dividends on its first preferred stock have been paid
since 1901, and on its second preferred since 1905. The common stock
cannot expect a dividend in any period which can be foreseen.</p>

floating debt—Failure—Struggles between Gowen and his
opponents—Reorganization—Second failure and reorganization.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad has been peculiarly unfortunate.
Although serving a region of abundant traffic, it failed three times
between 1880 and 1895, and was in the hands of receivers ten years.
It was reorganized after each failure, and each reorganization was
marked by bitter struggles between contending parties, due in part to
divergence in financial interests, and in part to personal rivalries.</p>

<p>In 1833 the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad was chartered by the
Legislature of Pennsylvania to build a road from Philadelphia to
Reading, a distance of 58 miles. Its early history does not concern
us. In 1862 it leased, owned, and operated 437.4 miles of track,
equivalent, roughly, to 119.4 miles of line; and derived $2,879,419
out of its gross earnings of $3,911,830 from the carriage of coal.
Its capitalization was extremely high, roughly, $193,417 per mile
of line,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> and the necessary payments each year, not including
dividends, took up $1,454,635. At this time the road owned no coal
lands, but, like the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Schuylkill Canal,
remained a common carrier, and relied upon the advantages of its
position in respect to the Southern coal fields to secure the tonnage
which it required.</p>

<p>From 1862 to 1865 inclusive the Reading enjoyed a period of extreme
prosperity. The Navy Department, during the war, required large
quantities of fuel, and in the revival of business after the
conclusion of peace the Reading took its part. Merchandise earnings
increased from $523,416 in 1862 to $1,165,277 in 1865; coal earnings
from $2,879,419 to $8,627,292; and though expenses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span> also increased,
yet net earnings grew from $2,375,247 to $5,236,655, and the balance
of earnings, after all charges had been paid, from $920,612 to
$2,632,566. Dividends meanwhile ranged from 14 per cent on the
preferred stock in 1862 to 10 per cent on both preferred and common
in 1866, though the majority of the distributions were made in stock.
On the whole, during the Civil War and for a whole year afterwards,
the Reading was able to carry without difficulty the burden of an
enormous capitalization. What increase in capital occurred at this
time was in stock, and did not add to the load, although the desire
to pay dividends on the increased stock led to the piling up of new
issues.</p>

<p>In 1869 an entirely new departure in Reading policy occurred. Whereas
the road had previously owned no coal lands, with the advent of Mr.
F. B. Gowen to the presidency it began to purchase on an enormous
scale. “The repeated and serious interruptions of the business of the
company,” said the annual report for 1871, “caused by strikers in the
coal regions during the last few years, and the many fluctuations
in the coal trade, produced by alternate periods of expansion and
depression resulting therefrom, have attracted the attention of the
managers of the company to the necessity of exercising some control
over the production of coal, so as to prevent a recurrence of the
difficulties heretofore experienced; and it was believed that the
best way to accomplish this result, without injuriously affecting
individual interests, was for the company to become the owner of
coal lands situate upon the line of its several branches.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
Further, it was felt that some steps were necessary to retain for
the Reading even the coal tonnage which it enjoyed. In 1871 every
rival carrier had invested large sums in coal properties, and all the
fields but the Schuylkill and Mahanoy (western middle) were occupied,
while carriers had begun to enter the Mahanoy district, and it was
reported to be their intention to build lines straight through to the
Schuylkill fields.</p>

<p>The anthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania lie in four main
districts: the Northern or Wyoming; the Southern or Schuylkill; and
two smaller intermediate fields known respectively as the Eastern
Middle or Lehigh region and the Western Middle or Mahanoy and
Shamokin basins. The Northern field is the more easily worked,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span> and
the Southern field is the richer.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> Between 1869 and 1881 the
Reading Railroad and its alter ego, the Coal &amp; Iron Company, formed
for the purpose, spent $73,326,668 for lands in the Schuylkill and
Western Middle districts, securing 142 square miles, or 60 per cent
of all the anthracite lands of these districts, and 30 per cent of
all in Pennsylvania. Of the purchase money $69,816,204 were supplied
either by the Railroad Company or by sale of Coal &amp; Iron Company
bonds which the Railroad Company guaranteed. The Coal &amp; Iron Company
incurred non-guaranteed liabilities for the rest.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> This gave
ample resources for the permanent supply of coal tonnage to the
railroad, and was sufficient also to give a considerable measure
of control over production in the Southern district. Independent
operators did continue, however, and the Reading coal was subject
to the competition of coal from other fields. More important still,
in attaining control, “all kinds of coal properties, good, bad,
and indifferent, were purchased without regard to original cost,
location, or revenue producing capacity.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> In 1880 an engineer
of reputation was appointed to evaluate the Reading coal lands, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
recommended the surrender of five properties that originally cost
$5,207,167, upon which there were encumbrances of $5,015,000. “But
little weight,” said he, “should be given to the fear that rivals
will possess the surrendered property; most of it is not a tempting
investment.” Exorbitant prices were paid for the lands purchased. By
1881, as noted, there had been expended in all by the two Reading
companies $73,326,668. This same report said that, “assuming the
profit on the future coal product to be 30 cents per ton of coal
shipped, that the company will be able to reduce the rate of interest
on the money needed to hold and develop the property from 7 per cent
to 6 per cent per annum, and that the development will be at the
rate just stated [outlined earlier in the report], the whole estate
has a value of $32,394,799: the company’s interest in the estate is
worth $30,630,648, and, including colliery improvements belonging to
the company, but situate on lands owned by others, the whole of the
company’s property is worth $31,197,484.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>It is unquestionable that the Reading did acquire an enormously
valuable property in the decade succeeding 1870. It seems just as
clear that it paid more for this than was necessary; but what is
perhaps more to the point is the fact that the Reading paid more
than it could afford. Whatever the ultimate advantages to be gained
by exclusive possession of any considerable section of the coal
fields, the Reading was not large enough nor financially strong
enough to make such vast purchases within so short a space of time.
The prosperity of the Civil War had disappeared, net profits were
fluctuating without marked tendency to increase, the figures for
1870 being actually less than those of 1863, while the interest
on bonds had more than doubled since 1867, and the sum required
for dividends had increased. To advance $54,886,647 to the Coal &amp;
Iron Company under these conditions, and to become responsible as
guarantor for $14,929,557 more, would have been ill-advised even
had the prices paid by the company been in strict accord with the
commercial estimate of the time. Under the best of circumstances
returns from much of the property acquired could not be secured for
many years. The parts of the coal fields which were worked yielded
an income, though it was seldom that the collieries were allowed to
run to their full capacity; but those districts which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span> were bought
for the sake of controlling the coal situation, or in order to secure
a future reserve, and which in many cases could not be worked at
existing prices, occasioned a drain upon the company to the amount of
interest on the purchase money, with no return of any kind. Moreover,
the purchase of the coal lands put the Reading in the anomalous
position of a railroad corporation interested in industrial lines.
It could no longer be content with encouraging the transportation of
its main source of revenue (coal), but had to care as well for the
price at which this coal was sold. When depression in the coal trade
came, the Reading lost both as producer and as carrier, for less was
transported, and that amount was sold at a lower price; but when good
times came, from which as a simple carrier it might have profited
largely, it struggled with conditions of over-production which should
rightly have been none of its concern. There was, finally, a peculiar
fatality in the time which the Reading chose for its expansion. The
year 1873 will always be remembered as one of the most disastrous
in the history of the United States. Commencing with the failure of
Messrs. Jay Cooke &amp; Co. on the 18th of September, the panic spread
with such rapidity as to lead to the closing of the New York Stock
Exchange on September 30. All railroad securities were exceedingly
depressed, call loans were high, and it was nearly impossible to
secure new capital. Business the next five years was very dull, and
the Reading actually earned less gross in 1879 than in the year
before the panic, and this at the very time that its liabilities were
so largely extended. The natural result was the financial difficulty
which can be detected as early as 1876. In June it appears that,
owing “to the continued depression in the iron and coal trades and
the consequent falling off in transportation,” the road was obliged
to reduce its working force. In July the usual dividend was passed;
salaries were lowered in September, and still later a temporary loan
was secured to tide over the floating debt, which then amounted to
$8,272,359. By the next year the matter had become serious enough to
necessitate a formal proposition to creditors for the postponement of
interest payments and of payments on the floating debt. The company
professed itself able to carry out the following:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To pay the interest on prior liens in full.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To pay one-half the interest on the general mortgage bonds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span> and
on the Perkiomen sterling mortgage bonds for three years in cash,
and one-half in five-year interest-bearing scrip, with the option to
the holder of receiving instead scrip for the three coupons first
maturing and cash for the rest.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To pay for five years in scrip the interest on the debenture
bonds of both the Railroad and Coal &amp; Iron Companies; the convertible
bonds of the Railroad Company, the bonds due in 1885, 1902, and 1918
of the Tidewater &amp; Susquehanna Canal Company, and so much of the
rent due to the Schuylkill Navigation Company as was applicable to
the payment of dividends to stockholders of the Company and to the
interest upon its mortgage loan of 1895.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) To suspend the drawings for the payments of sinking funds
and of the improvement and general mortgage bonds for a period not
exceeding four years, if so long a time should be required for the
payment of the floating debt.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>“The relief to be obtained from the above,” said President Gowen,
“will undoubtedly enable the managers, even with no improvement
in traffic or increase of rates, to meet the fixed charges on all
obligations of both companies other than those above named, and
to pay off the entire floating debt within such time as will be
satisfactory to the holders thereof.” Certain modifications were
suggested by the London securityholders, providing for trustees with
some power to protect the creditors,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and the plan went quietly
into effect.</p>

<p>From now on matters went from bad to worse. The year 1878 showed a
falling off in almost every source of revenue, while expenses and
charges remained very nearly the same. Depression in the coal trade
and connection with the Coal &amp; Iron Company, general dulness of
business after 1873, troubles with employees, over-capitalization,
all had their share in pushing the company still further into the
mire. It became unable to keep its share of the existing business,
and the percentages of the Schuylkill output carried by it steadily
decreased from 83.49 in 1877 to 75.45 in 1881, while its percentage
of the aggregate output from all the anthracite region diminished
from 32.82 to 24.44. “It appears, therefore,” said the annual report
for 1881, “that while other companies have steadily increased their
capacity of production by regular and judicious expenditures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span> for
new openings, breakers, machinery, and other facilities for mining
and delivering coal, the Reading Company has apparently remained
stationary.... For this policy the local officers in charge are not
probably responsible, as it was undoubtedly forced upon them by the
management, because of the impoverished and embarrassed condition of
the company’s finances.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>Throughout 1879 there was trouble over the payment of wages, perhaps
as good a sign of financial difficulty as can be desired. Employees
were paid in scrip, not cash, and even scrip wages were left overdue.
President Gowen went to Europe toward the middle of the year, but
not at all, as he carefully explained, in order to place a new loan,
or to transact any business except a little in relation to some
railroads for the company; in fact, the condition of the Reading was
an open secret, and new loans were impossible to obtain. In May,
1880, the New York and Philadelphia banks began to refuse further
accommodations. At the same time the period during which, according
to the agreement of 1877, cash payment of general mortgage coupons
was suspended, drew to a close, and on May 21 the Philadelphia &amp;
Reading announced its inability to meet its obligations. As was said
at the time, the company did not fall with a crash because it had not
far to fall.</p>

<p>The failure occurred on May 21, and on May 24 Messrs. F. B. Gowen
(president of the company), Edwin A. Lewis, and Stephen A. Caldwell
were appointed receivers. Their resources were scanty and they had
to do with them as best they could. On the one hand they applied to
the court for authority to borrow $1,000,000 to pay the wages of
employees and interest falling due July 1, and on the other they cut
down expenses by reducing the working force in the repair shops, by
putting the shops on short time, by discontinuing many of the trains
on different lines, and by ceasing all dead work at the collieries.</p>

<p>Before any plan could be proposed for the rehabilitation of the
company the condition of its finances had to be known, and this again
the receivers took in charge. Their report in June, 1880, showed
a sufficiently serious state of affairs. The floating debt of the
Railroad Company had mounted up to $10,254,766, besides $1,900,482
more for the Coal &amp; Iron Company. This represented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span> an increase
of $3,604,000 as compared with November 30, 1879, and an English
bondholders’ committee declared that only $2,930,000 of it were
represented by value.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> The rest had apparently been incurred in
desperate attempts to preserve the solvency of the company. The total
liabilities of the Railroad and Coal &amp; Iron Companies, including
mortgage, debenture debt, floating debt, and miscellaneous items,
but excluding stock, were $152,436,890. The deduction from these
figures of the Coal &amp; Iron bonds held by the Railroad Company, which
would have constituted a duplication of indebtedness, left a total of
$106,215,830.</p>

<p>The stock of the two companies amounted to $42,278,175, and the
stock in the hands of the public to $39,278,175. The grand total
of liabilities was thus the enormous sum of $145,494,005. The
charges for interest and sinking funds were $7,542,094, and the
annual payment of $5,629,764, due on $87,558,482 of railroad bonded
indebtedness, shows that the rate of interest upon the bonds was
high. The net revenue was $5,494,979, and there was therefore a
deficit of $2,047,115. Meanwhile the Coal &amp; Iron Company had reported
a regular deficit up to 1880, which, though not significant in
itself, because of close relations with the Railroad Company and the
impossibility of determining how much the Coal Company’s rightful
profits were reduced by exorbitant transportation rates, yet made it
very clear that from this source the Railroad Company could expect no
aid toward the cancellation of the railroad deficit revealed.</p>

<p>The combined companies were unable to earn their fixed charges: the
continuation of the struggle to do so was sure to mean, as it had in
the past, merely a piling up of the floating debt. The coupon-funding
scheme of 1877 had shown the inevitable result of temporary measures
of relief; and though business in 1880 was rapidly improving, there
was need for a radical reduction in the burden resting upon the
company. Pending action, a bill for foreclosure was introduced under
the general mortgage of 1874.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> A valuation of the Reading coal
properties, to which reference has already been made, was started.
It was entrusted at first to Mr. S. B. Whitney,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span> chief engineer of
the Coal &amp; Iron Company, and to Mr. Frank Carver, the land agent; but
was later given over to Mr. Joseph S. Harris, chief engineer of the
Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, in order to have the opinion of an
unprejudiced expert.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>The first suggestion for a plan of reorganization came from England.
The consolidated mortgage, prior to the general mortgage, was to be
foreclosed; general mortgage bonds were to be deprived of their right
to sue or to foreclose; all unsecured bonds and junior mortgages
were to be exchanged for preferred stock; and a $15 assessment was
to be levied upon the stock, for which collateral trust 7 per cent
bonds were to be given. This assessment was relied on to pay off
the floating debt, and the new company was to start free, with but
$33,564,000 of mortgage indebtedness.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>This plan was a step in the right direction. It recognized the
validity of prior liens, followed a sound principle in providing for
the floating debt by assessments upon the stock, and relieved the
company from the likelihood of a future failure by its treatment of
the general mortgage bonds; but it was weak in that it reduced the
general mortgage to the anomalous position of a bond entitled to a
fixed return without the power to enforce it. Stockholders, moreover,
objected strenuously to the assessment, maintaining that business
conditions were now such as to make milder measures sufficient.</p>

<p>In October, 1880, Mr. J. W. Jones, formerly vice-president of the
Reading Company, urged that an assessment on the stock was not
necessary, and proposed the following:</p>

<p>(1) To convert the income, debenture, and convertible bonds and scrip
into second preferred stock bearing 5 per cent interest if earned;</p>

<p>(2) To issue $15,000,000 of first preferred stock, with which to
retire the floating debt;</p>

<p>(3) To scale the Coal Company mortgage bonds $200,000 per annum,
which could possibly be done by consent of holders, if not, then by
foreclosure.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>The main difference between this and the English scheme lay in the
treatment of the floating debt. It is improbable, however, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span> the
substitute which this plan offered would have been sufficient, and
that the preferred stock could have brought $66, at which price alone
it would have covered the floating debt. Reading common stock was
selling in the middle of the month at 16⅜; general mortgage 6s were
bringing only 74¼, while debentures and convertible 7s were being
quoted at 28 and 37 respectively.</p>

<p>In October a representative of the English bondholders arrived in
Philadelphia for the purpose of examining into the condition of the
company, and the following month agreed with the board of managers
upon a reorganization committee to act in the United States. “The
probabilities are,” said this gentleman (Mr. Thomas Wilde Powell),
“that it will be found that the bondholders in London will be willing
to do as they did in the case of the Erie, that is, fund a reasonable
number of coupons ... for the purpose of setting at liberty a portion
of the revenue to pay unfunded claims.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> The next move in the
reorganization of the company came, however, not from this committee
but from President Gowen, the man who had led the Reading into the
purchase of coal lands, and who still remained in office in spite of
the hostility shown toward him. His scheme comprised two parts: the
first an issue of income bonds with which to pay off the floating
debt (together with $5,000,000 mortgage bonds); the second a grand
general mortgage to retire existing indebtedness. The plan in more
detail was as follows:</p>

<p>(1) The company was to create $34,300,000 deferred income bonds, on
which interest was to be deferred to a dividend of 6 per cent on the
common stock. After this amount had been paid the bonds were to take
all revenue up to 6 per cent and were then to rank <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari passu</i> with
the common shares for further dividends. The debentures were to be
issued at 30 per cent of their par value, or $15 per bond; and before
selling or disposing of said bonds in the market the option of taking
a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro rata</i> share was to be first offered to the stockholders of the
company.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>(2) A more permanent relief for the company was to be obtained
from the proposal to issue a new long time or perpetual 5 per cent
funding mortgage of $150,000,000, divided into two classes, A and B,
of $75,000,000 each: class A having priority of lien and interest
charge over class B. With this issue it was proposed, by purchase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
or exchange, to retire all outstanding indebtedness, and to acquire
by purchase the securities of the companies owning the leased lines.
It was estimated that $140,000,000 of the new issue would provide
for all of this, the total interest on which would be $7,000,000, as
against fixed charges for interest, sinking funds, and rentals, of
$10,657,116, making an annual saving of $3,657,116.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> Mr. Gowen
did not expect to secure so large an annual reduction, owing to the
impossibility of purchasing the higher securities and the probable
appreciation in value of the lower ones; but he did expect to realize
in all a saving of some $2,700,000.</p>

<p>In part this plan was commendable; in part it was inadequate, and
in part it relied on a mere juggling with words. The proposal to
unify all classes of indebtedness by a grand consolidated 5 per cent
mortgage was a good one, both in the simplification of accounts which
was to be expected, and in the reduction in fixed charges so far as
this reduction went; but on the one hand a reduction of $2,700,000
in charges was too little for a company which had reported for that
very year a deficit of $2,000,000, and on the other hand too little
allowance was made for the difficulty of forcing securityholders
without a foreclosure sale to submit to a definitive scaling down
of their holdings, with not even a preferred stock to show for the
sacrifice. In its handling of the floating debt, the plan was a
second edition of Mr. Jones’s stock-selling scheme, with all the
good points left out. What justification there could have been for
calling securities, such as the deferred incomes, “bonds,” which
were to be issued for no definite time, ranked even after the common
stock for dividends, and were of such doubtful character that Mr.
Gowen himself proposed to sell them for one-third of their face
value, does not appear; unless it be that the lack of voting power,
itself a disadvantage, entitled them to the more respected name.
The deferred income bonds were a device for saddling the holders of
the unsecured debt with a worthless certificate which they might
be induced to accept because of its name, and to which not even
the Reading stockholders could object. Furthermore, even if the
creditors had been eager for this new issue, in itself it would not
have been sufficient. The issue, if taken up, would have yielded
$10,200,000. It was proposed besides to sell $5,000,000 of unissued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
general mortgage bonds, which, after the success of the deferred
income bonds, it was presumed would sell at par. Income bonds and
general mortgage together promised a total of $15,200,000, or more
than $1,000,000 over cash requirements after commissions had been
paid.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>However poor the prospect, there was no lack of syndicate guarantee.
In November, 1880, a London syndicate agreed to deposit with an
American bank, to be named by the company, the sum of $2,058,000,
to be forfeited in case they failed to take at the issue price all
deferred income bonds not taken by the shareholders. This syndicate
further agreed that the company might retain, up to $1,000,000, out
of the deposit money, whatever might be necessary to make up a second
instalment of $4 on such neglected bonds.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Nothing was asked from
the company in return except the chance to sell the bonds purchased
at a premium. “As long as the bond- and shareholders find the money,”
remarked the London <cite>Times</cite>, “there is nothing to be said. In all
probability, however, these deferred bonds will become a medium for
the very worst kind of gambling, and their chances for a dividend
appear to us to be very small.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>In December Mr. Gowen’s plan received the approval of the American
committee and of the board of managers of the company. Bondholders
were in no way injured by the worthlessness of the deferred income
bonds, and only the most far-sighted could be expected to have
demanded a larger reduction in their claims. The same month a
meeting of London bond- and shareholders passed unanimously a
resolution expressing confidence in President Gowen, and adopting
his scheme.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Opposition came from the influential London banking
firm of McCalmont Bros., and the struggle centred about the annual
election set for January 10, 1881. The last of November or first of
December President Gowen issued a circular in which he said: “As I
am about to visit Europe on business of the company, and as it is
possible that I may not return until the first week in January, I
think it proper to call your attention to the fact that it is highly
important that all shareholders who can possibly do so should attend
the annual meeting in Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span> on the second Monday in January.
An effort will undoubtedly be made at the next election to control
the management of the company in the interest of rival lines, and if
the effort is successful the future of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading
Railroad Company will be little, if any, better than that of the
Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company, or of the Northern Central
Railroad Company.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> In Europe, or, more strictly speaking, in
London, Gowen busied himself in placing his deferred income bonds,
with apparently a very considerable measure of success. As to the
result of the coming election he professed absolute confidence. It
made little difference, said he, which way the McCalmonts decided to
vote their shares. He could be elected without any English votes at
all, and with the backing of the English bondholders who had resolved
to support him, the matter was not at all in doubt.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> On January
4, six days before the date set for the election, Gowen actually
issued a prospectus for his new income and mortgage loans, and cabled
to Vice-President Keim that he was satisfied that he could dispose of
the general mortgage A bonds at 110 and the general mortgage B bonds
at par.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile in America both parties had recourse to the courts: the
McCalmonts, to prevent the issue of the deferred income bonds,
and the friends of Mr. Gowen to get the election postponed in
order to give the president time to return from Europe. The latter
suit was the first decided. Judge McKennan, of the United States
Circuit Court, refused to grant an order, but unofficially advised
postponement. The board of managers therefore withdrew the notice
of the annual meeting, and on January 12 voted to postpone it
indefinitely. Counsel for the McCalmonts then made application to
the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia for a mandamus to compel
the board to call a meeting. They obtained a peremptory mandamus on
January 24, but accepted the date of March 14 as satisfactory, and
forbore further proceedings.</p>

<p>The matter of the deferred income bonds was complicated by a full
and complete authorization which Mr. Gowen had before obtained from
the Circuit Court for the issue of his bonds. The request of the
McCalmonts was twofold: the court was prayed to revoke the previous
decree, and to enjoin any further action in the negotiation or
consummation of the said scheme; or, failing this, to direct the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
officers of the company and the receivers to refrain from the issue
of the bonds until the form thereof should have been settled by the
said court, and also until deposit with the receivers should have
been made of the $2,058,000 provided as a guarantee.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> The first
request sought a prohibition of the issue; the second attempted to
delay the negotiation of the bonds until the annual election should
have passed and the McCalmonts should have had a chance to obtain
control. The immediate result was the transference to Philadelphia
of the $2,058,000 guaranteed, from its place of deposit in London.
In February the McCalmonts obtained a revocation of the original
grant of authority for the deferred income bonds, a continuance of
the suit for a preliminary injunction, and an order restraining the
respondents from “making any agreement or ordering any act by which
the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company [might] be definitely
bound touching the deferred bond plan or the proposed mortgage loan
of $150,000,000.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>In January the Coal &amp; Iron Company quietly held its annual election,
and chose Mr. Gowen president. As the time for the postponed election
of the Railroad Company came round, the activity of both sides became
intense. Both Gowen, who was still in London, and the McCalmonts
issued calls for proxies. The former appealed to the shareholders to
save the property from passing into the hands of the Pennsylvania
Central Railroad Company, which he said was believed to be the ruling
power behind the McCalmont litigation. The latter objected vigorously
to this charge, and pointed out that the Reading managers held only
16,500 shares of the company’s stock, and that some of them had
barely enough to qualify them for the positions which they held.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
The McCalmonts, furthermore, applied to the courts for an injunction
to prevent Gowen from voting on the shares pledged as collateral
for the floating debt. They maintained with some justification that
these shares could not legally be voted, and that it was particularly
illegal for the president to use them to elect himself.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>On March 12 the Court of Common Pleas issued a decree regulating
the conditions under which the election should be held, providing
for the separate count of votes of shares transferred three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span> months
before the election, and for the ultimate reference of all disputed
points to the Court. By this time Mr. Gowen had become alarmed at
the apparent strength of the McCalmonts, and had come to realize
that a possible disenfranchisement of a part of his own holdings on
the ground of too recent transference might lessen his chances of
retaining control. He recalled, however, that the annual meeting had
been postponed from January 10 to March 7, and finally to March 14.
This, it occurred to him, might transform it from a regular to a
special meeting, and might, according to the terms of the company’s
charter, make necessary the presence and vote of a majority of all
the shares outstanding, instead of a simple majority of all the
shares on hand. If this should be true a disenfranchisement of his
holdings would be of less importance; for whether disenfranchised or
not, these would form part of the total shares outstanding, of which
an absolute majority would be required.</p>

<p>On March 12, two days before the appointed date, Mr. Gowen issued a
letter to the shareholders. “I hold,” said he, “up to the present
time, the proxies of 1921 shareholders of the company, owning
359,500 shares of the capital stock, being very considerably more
than a majority of all the shares.... Of the shares for which I
hold proxies, so large a proportion, however, may possibly be
disenfranchised by failure to register, that if the legal meeting of
the stockholders is held on Monday next, and it should subsequently
be determined by the Court that three months’ prior registry is
essential to confer the right of voting, it may be possible that
the wishes of the great majority of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> shareholders may
be overruled by a minority.... I have determined to abstain from
attending the meeting, and I earnestly request all shareholders
who support the present management to absent themselves from the
meeting on Monday, and thus to give legal effect to their wishes by
making it impossible for the minority to secure the attendance of a
quorum....”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gowen’s friends, English and American, followed his suggestion;
and at the meeting on Monday but 211,095 out of 687,663 registered
shares appeared to vote. The immediate result was the almost
unanimous election of Mr. Bond, the candidate of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span> McCalmonts,
which was followed by litigation on the part of Mr. Gowen, disputing
the legality of the election. By the terms of the decree under which
the election had been held, the matter came first before the Court of
Common Pleas, which, on April 9, decided that the meeting had been a
legal one, and that the officers then voted for by the McCalmonts had
been duly elected. With the above court ranged against him, Mr. Gowen
took appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, and meanwhile declined
to surrender his position. On April 11 the new board proceeded to the
Reading offices in Philadelphia, made formal demand for admittance,
and were refused. On April 22 President Bond issued formal notice
of his election. An injunction was asked against Mr. Gowen, but was
held back until the Supreme Court should have taken action. Meanwhile
the old board of managers announced that if a decree supporting the
decision of the Court of Common Pleas should be rendered they would
make no further opposition; and the transfer agents of the company
in Philadelphia and New York refused to transfer any stock until the
dispute should have been settled. On April 19 an order of the United
States Court interfered with Mr. Gowen’s exclusive possession, and
compelled him to furnish to Messrs. Frank S. Bond, etc., suitable
accommodations in the offices of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad
Company, with free access to all books and papers. In May the Supreme
Court rendered its decision, holding the meeting of March 14 to have
been a regular meeting, and a majority of all the stock outstanding
not to have been required for a quorum. Gowen asked for a rehearing,
which was denied, and in June, nearly four months after the election,
he grudgingly acknowledged Mr. Bond and his associates as the legally
elected president and board of managers.</p>

<p>During all this time the deferred income bond scheme had not remained
untouched. In April, 1881, on application of the McCalmonts, the
United States Circuit Court at Philadelphia had granted a preliminary
injunction against it. “Whatever power the defendant has in the
premises can only be found in the general authority to borrow money,”
said Judge McKennan, and went on to state that the issue did not
constitute a loan, because a loan implied reimbursement, and the
income bonds were redeemable at no special time.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span> Mr. Gowen
promptly proposed to make them redeemable, and insisted that this
made them still more desirable. A week later the $150,000,000 general
mortgage was also enjoined.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>Once out of the presidency Mr. Gowen endeavored to induce the
McCalmonts to accept his plan. If they would adopt the deferred
income bond scheme, he said in an address to shareholders, he would
resign the receivership of the road at once, give bonds never to
stand for the presidency again, and further coöperate with them in
selecting a new board of directors. As an alternative he offered
to buy the McCalmont shares at $40 each, and threatened to beat
that party at the next election if it refused.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> In September
he assured the stockholders that he could without difficulty put
the road upon its feet. “If Bond and his colleagues will resign and
reinstate the old management,” he cabled from London, “and advise me
by cable of the change, I can, before sailing on Saturday, procure
sufficient advances against the proceeds of preferred [deferred?]
income bonds and new 5 per cent consols to pay the floating debt,
receivers’ certificates, and all arrears of interest.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Finally,
appealing to Mr. Bond direct, Gowen made formal application that
the new board should adopt his plan after changing the form of the
proposed obligations by making them payable in 100 or 200 years.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
Bond refused. He pointed out that the deferred income bondholders
would be in constant conflict with the management in their endeavor
to secure dividends on their holdings, and would attempt to prevent
proper and necessary expenditures upon the property from current net
revenues. He declared that it was questionable whether the company
had authority to sell its unsecured obligations below par, and that
in any case the process would be enormously expensive; and, further,
that the language of the obligation did not limit the payment of
interest to the source of net revenue only, but might be construed
to compel the declaration of 6 per cent on the income bonds whenever
6 per cent should be paid on the common stock.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> Failing in his
attempts to win over his opponents, Gowen turned his energies toward
securing their defeat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile President Bond brought forward a plan of his own.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span> He had
grasped three points of weakness in Gowen’s scheme, <span class="locked">namely,—</span></p>

<p>(1) The issue of a mass of worthless obligations in the deferred
income bonds;</p>

<p>(2) The high level of fixed charges which a $150,000,000 5 per cent
mortgage entailed;</p>

<p>(3) The lack of any security which had a right to interest only when
earned, and which might be given to the bondholders in return for
sacrifices which they would otherwise refuse to make.</p>

<p>He proposed, therefore, to create a general consolidated mortgage
to cover all the property of the Reading Railroad and Coal &amp; Iron
Companies, together with the interest of both companies in all other
corporations and property, whether owned or controlled by lease or
otherwise. This mortgage was to be junior to the consolidated and
to the improvement mortgages only, but was to contain a provision
by which, as bonds under these senior mortgages should be retired,
additional bonds might be issued under the new mortgage, which was
eventually to become a first lien upon all the properties of both
companies.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> The total was to be $150,000,000, to be divided into
two series: of which series A, for $90,000,000, was to run for fifty
years, and was to have a prior lien over series B upon the revenues
for interest at the rate of 4½ per cent, with a right to enforce
foreclosure in case of a twelve months’ default; and series B was
to run sixty years, and was to carry interest at 3 per cent, with a
right to enforce foreclosure in case of a three years’ default. In
prosperous years series B might receive more than 3 per cent: thus
the mortgage provided that from current net revenue applicable to
dividends it should get 1½ per cent additional interest before any
dividend should be paid on the stock of the company; after that 3
per cent might be paid on the capital stock, and then 1½ per cent
additional might be paid on series B; it being understood that the
interest in excess of 3 per cent should not be cumulative, but was
to be paid only from current net revenues of the company otherwise
applicable to dividends. These two issues of unequal worth were to
be used for different purposes. Series A was to be in part reserved
to retire the senior obligations, and in part to be sold to pay off
the general mortgage bonds, the general mortgage scrip, the income
bonds, the floating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span> debt of the Railroad and Coal &amp; Iron Companies
secured by collateral, the receivers’ obligations, and the mortgages
on real estate that could be paid off. Series B was to be exchanged
for the junior obligations, such as the debenture or convertible
loans, or was to be held in reserve for subsequent acquisition of the
guaranteed stock or obligations of affiliated corporations of the
Railroad and Coal &amp; Iron Companies.</p>

<p>What this meant for the immediate future was that all prior liens
were to remain untouched, while everything from the general mortgage
down was to be funded into the new obligations. In some ways this
resembled the earlier scheme of Mr. Gowen, since in each case there
was to be a $150,000,000 general mortgage in two parts, of which
one part was to have priority over the other, and in each case this
grand mortgage was to be used ultimately to retire all previously
existing indebtedness. An innovation was now made, however, in the
difference introduced between the two series. In Gowen’s scheme the
amount of each series was to be the same, and each was to fare alike,
except for the priority of series A; in that of President Bond,
series A was to be half again as large as series B, and was to bear
a higher rate of compulsory interest; although, a point of extreme
importance, the return upon series B was to run from a minimum of 3
per cent to a maximum of 6 per cent whenever the road should earn
it. Thus President Bond gained two things: he reduced the rate of
interest which his new bonds could claim in any year from 5 per cent
(as under Gowen’s scheme) to an average of something under 4 per
cent, which would yet, in prosperous times, net them as much as the
old bonds surrendered; and as a still further concession, he gave to
the 3 per cent bonds a term of sixty instead of fifty years, raising
their value to that extent. As the various existing issues of bonds
had different market values, he thought it proper to equalize these
values in the exchange by the grant of a bonus in stock, for which
the capital stock of the company was to be increased one-third.
Here were two of Gowen’s problems in a fair way of solution: the
reduction of fixed charges was accomplished, while some incentive
was given to the junior bondholders to assent. Scarcely less from
the point of view of sound finance was the gain from the abandonment
of the anomalous deferred income bond scheme, with its $34,300,000
of worthless speculative securities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span> Instead, the floating debt,
under President Bond’s plan, was to be cared for by the sale of
series A bonds, not at one-third their face value, but as near par
as possible; by the best of the company’s new securities, in other
words, and not by the worst. And, finally, the acquisition of the
securities of subsidiary roads was provided for rather ingeniously by
the conversion into series B bonds of $10,527,900 convertible 7 per
cent bonds, against which had perforce been reserved an equal amount
of stock. Conversion released the stock, which became a free asset
available for any uses to which the company saw fit to apply it.</p>

<p>Yet while the advance which the plan of President Bond marks over
that of President Gowen may be recognized, its defects must also
be observed. It was, in the first place, in common with all other
schemes suggested, too mild, too little drastic in its operations.
The condition of the Reading companies was desperate in the
extreme. By President Bond’s own figures the previous five years
had shown a deficit of $11,479,217, or an average loss per annum of
$2,295,853. The net earnings for 1881 by the same computation had
been $8,418,009, and the fixed charges $11,265,666.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> What was
needed was a radical scaling down of indebtedness, to take effect
not in the far distant future but at once. President Gowen, face
to face with a similar situation, had evolved a reduction in fixed
charges from about $11,000,000 to about $7,000,000, but had explained
that, owing to the impossibility of retiring all of the prior liens
at once, the actual figures would be approximately $7,957,000.
President Bond, less optimistic, or more honest, stated that the
ultimate charge under his plan would be about $6,000,000; but that
the immediate reduction would be to about $8,339,000 only, scarcely
more than $100,000 below the net earnings of the current year. Both
estimates would probably have been under the mark; but the relief
which President Bond proposed was utterly inadequate even on his
own showing. A margin of surplus earnings which could be wiped out
in a single month was no answer to the demand for a restoration of
the Reading companies to solvency. In regard to the floating debt,
too, Bond’s plan left something to be desired, in that it provided
for no assessment, but cared for the floating obligations by the
sale of bonds. The danger in relying upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span> the sale of securities to
supply the cash requirements of a bankrupt road has been mentioned
in connection with Mr. Gowen’s scheme, as indeed at other times
before. At best it is advisable only in prosperous times, and when
the bonds offered are of high grade; and though the series A bonds
might perhaps have been considered high grade, the prosperity of 1880
was not repeated in 1881, and a year of bankruptcy and litigation had
not improved the Reading’s credit. That the plan failed, however,
was due neither to its inadequacy nor to its method of dealing with
the floating debt; but rather to the resolute and uncompromising
opposition of Mr. Gowen and his friends, and to the determination
of the junior securityholders to stand out for better terms. This
twofold resistance caused a syndicate of bankers, which had been
relied upon to place the new loan, ultimately to reject it, and the
plan fell through.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>To return now to Mr. Gowen. This gentleman had been strengthening
his following in every possible way, and had secured one ally of
particular importance in the person of Mr. Vanderbilt, who in
October, 1881, was reported to be buying largely of the company’s
stock. Early in November Mr. Gowen and President Bond both issued
addresses to the shareholders. The former maintained that although
the present management had been in power for over four months it had
done nothing to extricate the company from its difficulties, and
promised that if elected he would “retain the office long enough to
place the company in a good financial condition, by completing the
issue of deferred income bonds and by issuing and selling the 5 per
cent consolidated mortgage bonds, the result of which will be the
resumption of dividends upon the company’s shares.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> The business
prospects of the company were never better, he continued, and the
wisdom of the purchase of the great anthracite coal estate was being
demonstrated. Bond, on the other hand, alluded to the failure of Mr.
Gowen’s many promises, to the wasteful expenditure of money, to the
coal speculations in which the road had been engaged, to the payment
of unearned dividends, and to other points of Gowen’s policy, actual
or alleged;<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> and his statements were repeated by the McCalmonts
in spite of Mr. Gowen’s vehement denials.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
The election was held from January 9 to January 14, 1882. There were
cast 493,601 votes, of which Gowen received 270,984 and Bond 222,617;
a result mainly due to the 72,000 Vanderbilt shares voted for Mr.
Gowen. The same meeting approved by resolution Gowen’s financial
plans, and called on the incoming board of managers to carry them
into effect. To clear the way a test suit was brought in the Supreme
Court of the state of Pennsylvania, and a close decision obtained
favoring the issue.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Counsel for the McCalmont Bros. petitioned
in the Circuit Court for leave to withdraw their complaint, stating
that the McCalmonts had disposed of almost all their holdings, and
the Circuit Court vacated the injunction which it had previously
granted.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>Gowen’s plan was now triumphantly brought forward, with the few
alterations which time had suggested. There was to be as before a
deferred income bond issue of $34,300,000, which was to retire the
floating debt; the general mortgage was to be increased in amount
from $150,000,000 to $160,000,000, but was still to be divided into
two series, equal in amount, and differing in privileges only on
the point of priority of lien; of which series A was ultimately to
exchange for the senior, series B for the junior obligations of the
company. $13,500,000 of the first series and $10,000,000 of the
second series were to be put out at once, and $4,000,000 convertible
adjustment scrip were to be issued to settle back coupons. Time had
apparently made more modest Mr. Gowen’s estimate of the saving to
be secured; for instead of not more than $7,000,000 as before, he
now hoped for fixed charges of not more than $8,000,000; but with
undaunted optimism he made up for this admission by glowing pictures
of what the company in the future was going to earn. “Net earnings
last year” (1881), said he, “were over $10,000,000—in 1882 they may
be expected to reach $11,000,000, and they will before long be over
$12,000,000. With net earnings of $12,000,000, and fixed charges of
$8,000,000, there will remain a dividend fund of $4,000,000, equal
to 6 per cent on the share capital, and 6 per cent upon the par,
or 20 per cent upon the issue price, of the deferred income bonds.
“In order to get the property out of the hands of the receivers an
earnest effort was made to sell the $13,500,000 series A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span> bonds
of which mention has been made, but at the minimum price of 98
subscriptions for but $723,500 were received, and the company was
obliged to have recourse to the $5,000,000 unissued general mortgage
7 per cent bonds, which it fortunately had at its disposal. Even
before this the management had been forced to abandon any immediate
attempt to retire the old general mortgage bonds,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> and had been
compelled to answer inquiries as to the reasons for a decline in the
price of the deferred income bonds. On February 28 the receivers
of the Railroad and Coal &amp; Iron Companies formally surrendered the
control of the property to the officers of those corporations.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the reconstructed company was the lease for
999 years of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. This road in many
ways formed a natural complement to the Reading system. Like it, it
was a coal road, carrying something less than half as great a tonnage
as the Reading itself, and owning extensive coal lands in the Wyoming
region; while in location it supplied the necessary connection
between the Reading lines and New York. At a later date Mr. Joseph
S. Harris testified that all the business of the Reading coming from
the South or Southwest went to New York over the Central; while, on
the other hand, business from the Northwest was carried by the Jersey
Central from Scranton, where its lines began, to Bethlehem, and was
there handed to the Reading for transportation to Philadelphia.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
The advantages of the Central to the Reading were thus enumerated by
General Traffic Manager Bell in 1885: “The joint traffic with the
Central Railroad, outside of coal, and outside of passengers, adds
$1,500,000 to the revenue of the old Reading system. By means of the
Lehigh &amp; Susquehanna division of the Central Road we extend from
Phillipsburg to Scranton or Green Ridge through the entire Lehigh
Valley; that system feeds our North Pennsylvania line; it is our
connection for the Catawissa system by way of Tamanend and Tamaqua;
it is the connecting link in the cross line or Allentown system;
it creates the shortest line from interior Pennsylvania, and from
Northwest Pennsylvania to New York waters. Through the operations of
the lease we reach the largest slate territory in Pennsylvania, and
the largest iron producing furnaces anywhere in this country, with
the exception of Pittsburg.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span><a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> In 1883 the Central was bankrupt
with no immediate prospect of recovering from its difficulties,
and had therefore an incentive to accept any arrangement by which
interest on its obligations should be paid; while Mr. Gowen, with
misplaced confidence in his scheme of reorganization, was ready to
put fresh burdens on his road in the hope of future gain.</p>

<p>Rumors of a lease were abroad in 1882, and after the termination
of the Reading receivership the operation was pushed to a speedy
conclusion. The Reading undertook to assume all the obligations
of the Central, and to pay 6 per cent on its capital stock then
outstanding, as well as $18,000 annually for maintaining the
corporate organization of the lessor. In case any of the Central
bonds should be retired, or rentals or interest reduced, the rental
to be paid by the Reading was likewise to be reduced. The roadbed and
rolling stock of the Central was to be maintained undiminished, but
if the Reading should make any additions or improvements, or if from
its own funds it should pay off any of the Central’s obligations,
it was to receive equivalent bonds with interest not exceeding 6
per cent from the Central Company. The lease was terminable on 60
days’ notice in case the lessee should fail at any time to carry out
its provisions.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> This involved something more than a nominal
obligation. The net earnings of the Jersey Central in 1882 had
been $5,091,072, while the sum due for rentals, interest, 6 per
cent dividends, etc., had mounted up to $5,898,087, not including
payments on car trusts or certain contingent obligations. Broadly
speaking, the Reading proposed to guarantee 6 per cent on the stock
of a road which had failed because unable to meet its fixed charges;
and however great the ultimate advantages, it is apparent that the
prospect of a drain upon the Reading Company was real. In order to
get the road out of receivers’ hands, the Reading had further to
take care of a floating debt of $2,062,000, and to compromise with
certain creditors by settling back interest on their bonds. This was
done, and on May 29, 1883, possession formally passed over. The same
day was concluded another arrangement, whereby the Central of New
Jersey leased the coal and railroad companies comprised in the Lehigh
Coal &amp; Navigation Company for one-third of their gross receipts, and
the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad became liable for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span> faithful
execution of the contract. The Reading agreed that the Lehigh coal
lands should be developed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari passu</i> with its own, so that the
product of the two estates should be constantly as 28 to 72 until the
Lehigh production should reach 3,000,000 tons. The rental of the road
was not in any year to be less than $1,414,400, nor more than a sum
rising from $1,728,700 before 1887 to $1,885,800 from 1887 to 1892,
and $2,043,000 after 1892, plus certain minor payments; and there was
provision for arbitration of any disputes which might arise.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>The year 1883 now seemed to find the Reading imbued with new life.
Earnings increased, both gross and net, fixed charges as reported
rose less rapidly, and the net profits for the year, or balance on
all operations, showed a threefold increase. “The company,” said Mr.
Gowen, “has now surmounted the difficulties of the last four eventful
years.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> The annual meeting in January was a genuine love-feast,
marked by the presentation of resolutions highly flattering to Mr.
Gowen. “We trust,” said one, “we thankfully appreciate your herculean
efforts in our behalf, in the face of unparalleled difficulties and
obstacles, in rescuing our property from bankruptcy against the
malignant and determined efforts of its enemies and conspirators to
foreclose and wreck it.” “As citizens of this great commonwealth,”
said another, “we beg to add our gratitude and admiration for your
untiring, brave, honest, and able devotion, which has preserved the
Philadelphia &amp; Reading Company intact, and has fairly started it on
a broader career of usefulness.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> Not less extraordinary was the
further action of this harmonious meeting. In the first place, it
authorized the creation of a collateral trust loan of $12,000,000 for
the purpose of paying the floating debt, the balance due upon the
purchase of Central Railroad Company of New Jersey stock, and the
retirement of the outstanding income mortgage bonds. What, may be
inquired, had become of the deferred income bonds of which Mr. Gowen
had been so proud, and the $5,000,000 additional first series consols
which with them were to cover the floating debt, if a new collateral
loan was needed for the purpose for which they had been considered
ample? As for the purchase of Jersey Central shares, an account
would require<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span> a chapter in itself. The intent had been to secure
more complete control of this subsidiary road. The purchase had been
made on margin in May. By January, 1884, more funds were necessary
to carry the stock; and as the business depression grew acute, the
Reading was obliged to seek a time loan from Mr. Vanderbilt, and to
pledge the purchased securities as collateral therefor. When the
loan matured Reading was no better off than it had been before, and
Vanderbilt, who seldom mixed philanthropy with business, sold the
stock. The original purchase had been at 78; the prices obtained when
the stock was thrown on the market ranged from 57 to 50, and the
Reading lost the difference, besides those advantages which it had
expected to gain.</p>

<p>In the second place, the meeting proposed a dividend of 21 per cent
on the preferred stock, representing arrears due, and of 3 per cent
on the common; both cash, and to be paid in case the collateral
loan should succeed.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> In order to give shareholders time to
consider, an adjournment was taken for two weeks, after which the
dividend on the preferred stock was approved, though that on the
common was not. It seems almost superfluous to insist upon the folly
of this dividend. The Reading had not, in reality, “surmounted the
difficulties of the last four eventful years.” Scarcely any of the
benefits promised by Mr. Gowen’s plan of reorganization had been
secured; fixed charges had not been reduced, because it had been
found impossible to get creditors to take new securities in exchange
for the old, and equally impossible to sell any considerable amount
of the new securities for cash. While old charges had remained
unabated, new charges had been added through the lease of the Jersey
Central, new car trusts, and the like, and the very gain in earnings
which might have been construed as favorable was due to increased
mileage, and was not proportional to the growth of the system.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
A fitting sequel to Mr. Gowen’s words and acts was the scrip payment
for labor and supplies which took place in May, 1884, and the
accompanying fall in the prices of the company’s securities. On June
2 the company again passed into receivers’ hands. The same judges
were applied to as in 1880, and the same receivers were appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
except that Mr. Gowen, who had given up the presidency of the
company, was replaced by Mr. George de Keim, his successor.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>The various creditors had now to do what should have been done
before, and, by lightening the charges upon the road, to put it in
a position where its solvency could be maintained. The chances for
obtaining radical action from the bondholders were somewhat brighter,
since even the most obstinate were being forced to realize that no
halfway measures would avail; and a reasonable solution was even thus
early hinted at in the suggestion that some of the bonds under which
the road was staggering should be replaced by stock. Nevertheless,
we shall find in this reorganization a slow working out of the
requirements for a plan, and a slow process of at least partial
reconcilement to the inevitable.</p>

<p>The receivers’ report was issued in October, but contained little
not known or suspected before. From November 30, 1883, to June
2, 1884, there had been a net loss in operation for the Railroad
Company of $2,322,282, and for the Coal &amp; Iron Company of $1,049,702,
showing conclusively the condition of the companies. The total
bonded indebtedness was $94,613,042; a total to be compared with
the $78,101,894 of four years previous. The total floating debt
was $16,549,968 as compared with $10,254,766 at the beginning of
the previous receivership. Including the Central of New Jersey,
the total fixed charges for the Railroad and Coal &amp; Iron Companies
were $18,241,051; a sum which certain offsets, however, reduced to
$16,584,732.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>The first suggestion for a reorganization came from a committee
primarily representing the general mortgage bondholders, though
including other interests as well. The chairman was Mr. Townsend
Whelen, and the committee may be taken to represent the views of the
management. “The present fixed charges of the company,” said Mr.
Whelen, “are in round numbers $16,650,000, while the earnings of the
past fiscal year are, in round numbers and after proper deductions,
$12,900,000. The objects sought to be accomplished by the committee
are:</p>

<p>“(1) To reduce fixed charges to the limit of last year’s earnings;</p>

<p>“(2) To preserve the proper order of priorities of each class of
securities, so that no income applicable to any senior security that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
remains unpaid can by any possibility be diverted to paying the
interest on a junior security;</p>

<p>“(3) To provide a method of paying the floating debt.”</p>

<p>The plan was, roughly, to leave the prior liens untouched, to fund
one-half the coupons upon the general mortgage for three years, and
to convert all of the other obligations into income bonds. Preferred
stock was to be changed from cumulative to non-cumulative; rents of
leased lines, including the Central of New Jersey, were to be reduced
to the amounts which the properties had earned; the canal leases
were to be reduced; the interest on some of the divisional coal land
mortgages was to be reduced, and on some was to be paid in full. In
regard to the floating debt the committee decided to postpone any
attempt to raise money for its extinction. If the bondholders should
accept the scaling down of their indebtedness, the company might
have no difficulty in procuring cash by a collateral loan; if this
should prove impossible, the duty of providing funds would devolve
upon the junior securities.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> The committee found it impossible
to prepare within the short time at their disposal a complete plan
of reorganization with exact figures of present and proposed fixed
charges; and it is therefore impossible to ascertain how great was
the saving which they expected to secure.</p>

<p>The plan marks sufficiently well the advance which had been made
since the reorganization of 1880–3. The best that could then be
imagined had been the creation of a grand general mortgage for
which the old bondholders might, but mostly did not, exchange their
holdings; while now the very first suggestion endeavored to retain
for all bondholders a chance for the same return as before, and
found the salvation of the company in the transformance of certain
bonds from mortgage to debenture obligations. The general criticisms
which may be made are three: first, that it was unwise to defer
all provision for the floating debt; second, that the new income
bonds might better have been replaced by stock; and third, that the
probable reduction in fixed charges would have been insufficient. So
far as the committee suggested any action in relation to the floating
debt, it favored a funding of it. This funding might have been
either into mortgage or into income bonds: if the former, the fixed
charges of the company would have been increased, or else the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
mortgage bondholders would have been compelled to accept a lower
rate of interest; if the latter, the volume of securities of slight
value would have been increased, or the junior securities would have
had to take less for their holdings. The action taken would have
gone far to determine what classes of securities would assent, while
in the absence of definite declaration it was on the whole likely
that all classes would hold off. As for the income bonds, it is in
general true that they are an unsatisfactory sort of security, and
likely to hinder the legitimate increase of capital. Most important
was the question of fixed charges. It will be remembered that of
the first and second series 5s of the previous reorganization only
$23,500,000 had been intended for immediate sale, and that of these
but a portion had been disposed of; and yet these consols were
the only securities the nature of which was really changed by the
Whelen plan. Interest had been optional before on the income bonds,
the convertible bonds, the convertible adjustment scrip, debenture
and deferred income bonds; interest was not made optional on the
general mortgage or prior liens. The result would not have been, in
spite of the reduction in rents and the scaling of the divisional
coal mortgages, any sufficient lessening of the fixed requirements.
This fact was, moreover, perceived. The board of managers, to whom
the scheme was reported, concluded a favorable opinion with the
declaration, “to conclude, we are satisfied that the large economies
already in operation, with those which are still being introduced,
should be regarded as a margin to meet adverse contingencies....
That the revenue we reckon on, though reasonably certain under such
reorganization, will surely not be realized in case the property
should be torn asunder by foreclosure sale.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> In other words they
relied, much as Mr. Gowen had done two years before, on a subsequent
increase in earnings to ensure the solvency of the company. A final
objection made at the time was that the plan asked too little of the
junior securities.</p>

<p>The Whelen plan was reported to the general managers’ committee,
and was approved by them. Some slight modifications were made, and
a large number of signatures was secured. Opposition was not slow
to spring up. In February a meeting of general mortgage bondholders
elected a committee, known as the Bartol Committee, to prepare a
plan more suited to their interests. This body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span> conferred with
the Whelen Committee, and two members from each were selected to
construct a new reorganization plan.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> In March it reported to
its constituents that it had made all the concessions which were
possible without sacrificing the interests of the general mortgage
bondholders, and that in spite of this, the negotiations had not
proved successful.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>In April, ten months after the beginning of the receivership, the
Reading managers evolved a plan for dealing with the floating debt.
Holders were to agree to accept renewals at intervals of three months
for three years, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent, paid at the
time of each renewal, and to hold the collateral pledged as security
until the whole of the debt should have been discharged. In case the
Philadelphia &amp; Reading should fail at any time punctually to pay the
interest on any of the obligations agreed to be renewed, or should
fail to cause the same to be renewed, or in case nine-tenths of the
floating-debt holders should not assent to the plan, or in case
an adverse judicial sale should be made, the obligation to accept
further renewals should immediately cease.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> The scheme deservedly
fell through. Creditors were asked to tie up their assets for three
years, with no concession in return except the payment of interest
quarterly in advance; while the unofficial suggestion that the
Reading pay ¼ per cent commission on each renewal was felt to be too
expensive for the company to entertain.</p>

<p>The following month the Whelen and Bartol committees came out with
a new edition of the Whelen plan, which introduced an assessment on
the junior bonds and stock, but preserved the same method of dealing
with the old securities as before.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> Assent to the plan was to be
on the condition that sufficient money should be raised to pay off
the floating debt. Interest on such debt was not to have priority
of payment over interest on the general mortgage for longer than
three years; and during those three years the preference was to be
limited to that part of the floating debt secured by collateral
yielding income to cover interest, or important for other reasons
to be retained. There were to be seven reorganization trustees to
receive the assents of parties in interest, and to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span> and hold
the securities and assessments thereon pending reorganization, and
when accomplished to return such securities duly stamped to their
respective owners.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> The trustees were further to decide whether
the assents to the plan in question should be considered adequate,
and if they should conclude on or before May 1, 1886, by a vote of
six of their number, that the assents were not sufficient, they were
to call into a council the managers of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading
Railroad Company, the receivers of that company, and the committees
of the general mortgage (Bartol) and income mortgage bondholders;
and this council, by a vote of four of the five interests therein
represented, was to formulate a plan of reorganization adapted to
the circumstances, and involving no larger contribution in money to
be paid than under the plan as then modified; and under such power
the trustees were to proceed to foreclose under such mortgage or
mortgages as they might deem advisable.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> The plan was obviously
a compromise whereby the Whelen Committee clung to the main lines
of its previous proposition, and the Bartol Committee secured
modifications which benefited the general mortgage at the expense of
the junior securities. Criticisms which applied to the earlier plan
largely apply to this also; but it is to be noticed that at last
the idea of funding the floating debt was abandoned for the sounder
scheme of paying it off in cash. The reorganization trustees were an
innovation, but were destined to be a useful one. On the whole the
compromise was a step forward; and yet it was not more successful in
obtaining assents than the scheme which had preceded it. Although the
directors approved it, as was to have been expected, the bulk of the
bondholders held off.</p>

<p>Matters now went on in much the same old way. The seven
reorganization trustees, representing the principal interests
concerned, held meeting after meeting with no apparent result. The
courts became impatient; bondholders clamored for their interest; but
after the failure of the earlier plan the way out seemed harder and
harder to find. In September, 1885, Mr. E. Dunbar Lockwood addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
an open letter to Mr. John B. Garrett, one of the trustees, in which
the following points were made:</p>

<p>(1) “The trustees should recognize promptly and unequivocally that
the Reading Railroad is bankrupt, and has not sufficient available
assets to meet its obligations.</p>

<p>(2) “Two dollars of obligations cannot be paid with one dollar and a
half of assets, and the sooner all persons interested ... recognize
this fact, and agree to scale both principal and interest sufficient
to meet the obligations of the company and put it upon a strong
financial basis, with sufficient working capital to enable it to
conduct its future business economically, the better it will be for
all concerned.</p>

<p>(3) “The trustees should look only at the facts as they exist ...
and while endeavoring to rehabilitate the road, also bring it into
harmonious relations with its adversaries.</p>

<p>(4) “The trustees should consider the problem ... precisely as
business men consider the matter of the settlement of a bankrupt
firm. The question at once presents itself, is it best that the
company should continue in business, or should it be wound up?”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>In his reply Mr. Garrett pointed out the difficulties to be overcome,
and concluded by saying that in his judgment no reorganization
would be final that did not ensure the establishment of credit, the
entrusting of the management to an interest having an actual equity
in the property, and just expectation of pecuniary return from it,
and harmony with competing lines, coupled with due regard for the
rights of the public.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>The reorganization trustees by this time appeared discouraged, and
the following month called a conference of creditors at which a
resolution was passed looking toward foreclosure. In November a suit
was actually begun, supplementary to a similar suit instituted a
year before. It was during the pendency of these proceedings that
the plan of reorganization devised by the reorganization trustees
themselves came out, and marked a third effort to rehabilitate the
road. The first plan proposed, it will be remembered, had suggested
the conversion of all of the junior securities into income bonds,
plus a funding of one-half the general mortgage coupons for three
years; and the second had introduced an assessment on the junior
bonds and stock. This third plan, while preserving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span> assessment,
and making it more severe, added a provision for the conversion of
general mortgage liens into 3 per cent bonds, and of junior liens
into preferred stock. For the ultimate retirement of the prior liens
a new fifty-year 5 per cent mortgage was to be created; for both the
prior and general mortgage liens the difference between the return
from the old bonds and that from the new was to be adjusted by the
use of 5 per cent preferred stock, so that bondholders in prosperous
times would not find their incomes diminished. Preferred stock was to
be of two kinds, of which the first was to go to satisfy the general
mortgage bondholders and for assessments, while the second was to
exchange at varying rates for the junior securities above the second
series 5s. Everything below the second series 5s was to receive
common stock instead. Under the scheme the company’s obligations
would have been reduced to $60,731,000, of which $33,400,000 prior
liens and $24,686,000 new 3 per cents; while its stock would have
been increased to the very considerable figure of $96,516,282.
The total cash assessments, if all paid, would have amounted to
$13,506,620; and, joined with the balance of stock, were expected to
be sufficient to cover the floating debt. The new fixed charges were
to be $7,064,830.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p>Various points in the plan deserve mention. For the first time since
the failure of 1880 it was proposed to use two kinds of securities,
of which interest on one should be fixed, and interest on the other
optional. For the retirement of senior bonds President Bond had
suggested a bond on which half the interest should be fixed and the
other half variable, but his plan had been inferior in flexibility to
the one now proposed. The junior securities received less favorable
treatment than before; but the general mortgage itself did not
escape, and was required to accept 3 per cent plus preferred stock
instead of a mere funding of its coupons. The increase in the amount
of stock was very great, and naturally so, in view of the new uses
to which it was put.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> Assessments were made heavier, and for the
first time the management frankly excluded from their calculations
the Central of New Jersey, foreshadowing the abandonment of the
lease. To repeat, the first two plans described had developed the
idea of an assessment and the conversion of the junior bonds into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
income obligations. To this the reorganization trustees added the
use of preferred stock, and, more important still, the combination
of two securities, respectively with obligatory and optional liens,
which were to be given for the general mortgage bonds. In principle
the result was excellent, in practice the degree of reduction was
somewhat too slight from the point of view of the company, although
it seemed more than the creditors were willing to accept. The general
mortgage bondholders in particular were loud in their protest. “The
truth of the matter is this,” said one of them, “while the plan of
the trustees has much to commend it, and is based on an excellent
theory, it fails to cover the whole ground, and falls terribly short
of meeting our reasonable demands.” Thus, although the Bartol and
Whelen committees accepted the plan, matters again stood still for a
while, while the financial powers talked and wrote and threshed the
question out.</p>

<p>In February, 1886, the reorganization trustees received a letter
signed by J. Pierpont Morgan and John Lowber Welsh, which is
important enough to be quoted in full.</p>

<p>“A syndicate has been formed,” said these gentlemen, “composed
of leading bankers and capitalists here and in Europe, together
with corporations or their representatives controlling large
transportation and coal producing interests, who have agreed to
subscribe in the aggregate $15,000,000 for the purpose of aiding in
the reorganization of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company and
its affiliated lines. The syndicate has no commitment of any kind
with any other railroads or corporations upon this subject beyond
securing a management in harmony with the principle that capital
invested in internal improvements should be so managed as to result
in a fair return in the way of interest and dividends. Their object
and purpose is to secure the reorganization on business principles
for the Philadelphia &amp; Reading bondholders, stockholders, and
creditors without prejudice to the relative position of either, and
in their interest only.</p>

<p>“To do this effectually there must be suitable arrangements made
with the Pennsylvania Railroad and other kindred coal interests for
harmonious relations, in order that suitable prices may be obtained
for coal produced and shipped. These objects we shall endeavor to
secure, and we now enclose you a copy of a correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span> with Mr.
Roberts, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, on these subjects,
which seems to us sufficient to warrant the syndicate in placing
reliance upon the assurance given by that company.</p>

<p>“As the reorganization shall proceed our effort and expectation will
be to bring about satisfactory arrangements with all the anthracite
coal roads, and also the trunk lines, which shall secure to the
Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, when reorganized, its just
share of the business at remunerative rates.</p>

<p>“The syndicate have believed that your plan was, in the main,
suitable for the purpose of reorganization, and that your board was
composed of gentlemen who would command the confidence of all parties
in interest.</p>

<p>“They therefore prefer to make an arrangement with you and to aid you
in working out a plan.</p>

<p>“But they also think that there should be certain modifications as to
your organization, and also as to your plan, as follows:</p>

<p>“(1) The syndicate would wish two persons, to be named by them, added
to your board.</p>

<p>“(2) Your plan should be made so flexible that it could be modified
hereafter in such respects as may be found necessary to success.</p>

<p>“(3) There should be an executive committee of five to take charge
of the foreclosure proceedings, the purchase of the property, the
organization of the new company, and generally of whatever may
properly appertain to reconstruction under the plan. There should
be five voting trustees who should vote on the stock when deposited
under the plan, and to whom the power of voting on the stock in
the reorganized company should be confided for five years after
reorganization. These two committees should be composed of parties
satisfactory to the syndicate and the trustees, and shall fill their
own vacancies. But in case the syndicate and trustees cannot agree
upon the five, then, and in that case, three shall be named by the
syndicate and two by the trustees, and each class shall fill any
vacancy occurring in its own number.</p>

<p>“(4) The compensation to be allowed to the syndicate shall be 5 per
cent on the amount of the syndicate capital.</p>

<p>“(5) The syndicate to be allowed interest at the rate of 6 per cent
upon any amount they may advance the company in the course of the
process of foreclosure and reorganization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
“(6) Proper provision must be made for securing to the syndicate the
refunding of the money they may advance on account of interest not
exceeding 4 per cent per annum on the general mortgage bonds during
reconstruction, and also for the substitution of the syndicate in the
place of any creditor or stockholder who may abandon his holding and
refuse to pay his assessment, it being the purpose of the syndicate
to pay 4 per cent per annum interest on the general mortgage bonds
during reconstruction, and also to pay the assessments of such
parties as may abandon their holdings or right to take the securities
to which they may be entitled under the plan.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p>The correspondence with Mr. Roberts referred to contained the
assurance that the Pennsylvania Company would not hold aloof from
an understanding with the Reading either in respect to the coal or
transportation business, and would, moreover, “cordially unite in
the arbitration of all differences.”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> This could not, of course,
force distasteful terms upon the Reading bondholders, but it could
and did supply sufficient capital to ensure the success of any plan
adopted, and it infused confidence and vigor into the action of the
nearly discouraged reorganization trustees. The executive committee
which they were to name was perhaps a useful tool, but the suggestion
of a voting trust was a genuine contribution, and aided powerfully in
securing necessary backing for future schemes.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that the syndicate appeared with no panacea,
was without a plan of its own, and at first merely adopted that of
the trustees, with a few modifications which it thought advisable;
but that by March, 1886, it had so worked over the proposals of the
reorganization trustees as to make in many respects a new plan;
which retained the assessments, likewise the combination of fixed
and optional charges and the use of preferred stock, but reserved
4 per cent bonds against prior liens, gave 4 per cent bonds with
preferred stock in exchange for the general mortgage instead of 3 per
cents, and created four classes of stock instead of three. Somewhat
more in detail this plan was as follows: The Reading was to issue a
new 4 per cent general mortgage for $100,000,000, and four kinds of
stock: a preferred, income, consolidated, and common. Of the general
mortgage $9,792,000 were to be for future use in the improvement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span> of
the railway; of the remainder $38,422,000 were to be reserved against
prior liens; $24,686,000 were to exchange for the general mortgage
if such should not be paid off in cash; $15,000,000 were to take up
shares or bonds of leased lines, and $10,000,000 were to exchange
for or to redeem Coal &amp; Iron Company divisional mortgages. The total
amount issued was to be $90,208,000, and no mortgage in addition
was to be placed on the Reading properties for five years after the
reorganization without the consent of a majority of the preferred
stockholders. Of the different classes of new stock the preferred
was to be given dividends up to 5 per cent non-cumulative, and then
the income and consolidated stocks were to have up to 5 per cent
non-cumulative. Generally speaking, the preferred stock was to go for
assessments; the income stock for the income mortgage and convertible
adjustment scrip; the consolidated stock for the first series 5s and
one-quarter of the principal of the second series 5s; the common
stock for the rest of the second series 5s, for the convertible
debentures, deferred income bonds, and for old preferred and common
stock. New fixed charges were estimated at $6,971,687, which
dividends on the preferred stock would raise to $8,198,636. There was
to be a voting trust for five years, consisting of J. Lowber Welsh,
J. P. Morgan, Henry Lewis, George F. Baer, and Robert H. Sayre; and
a syndicate was to advance necessary expenditures and disbursements
pending reorganization, including unpaid assessments. The syndicate
compensation was to be 6 per cent on its advances, plus a commission
of 5 per cent upon its $15,000,000 of subscribed capital. The
property was to be sold at foreclosure sale, and a new company was to
be organized.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>A comparison of this with the plan of the reorganization trustees at
first announced will show the changes made. Nothing of value which
previous reorganizations had worked out was cast aside. The fixed
interest allowed the general mortgage bondholders was raised in the
hope that they might support the plan, and more care was taken to
follow the order of priority in the advantages offered to the various
classes of junior securityholders; an end to which the four classes
of stock were admirably adapted. The voting trust was altogether new,
and was doubtless intended to ensure a policy in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span> accord with the
syndicate’s wishes for a series of years, and to prevent a renewal
of the vagaries of Mr. Gowen’s administration. The provision for
foreclosure was to be expected in view of the extreme difficulty of
obtaining the assents of so many conflicting interests; but with a
net revenue of $12,026,309 (both companies) and fixed charges of
$6,971,687, the task of maintaining the solvency of the companies in
future did not seem an impossible one.</p>

<p>In opposition to the plan the Lockwood Committee urged that
the scheme was unjust to certain classes of bonds; that it was
cumbersome, expensive, conferred power on the trustees which should
have been reserved for the direction of the new company, and that the
reserved powers to change any part of the plan, and the uncertainties
connected with the settlements under it, involved risks which
creditors should not accept.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The objections were not weighty.
If the Lockwood or any other committee had proved itself able to
formulate and carry through a plan, or if the syndicate arrangement
had been proposed at the very beginning of the receivership,
bondholders might fairly have criticised its expense. In point of
fact numerous attempts to reconcile divergent interests had failed,
and what with Messrs. Lockwood, Bartol, Whelen, Gowen, and their
respective followings, the future offered no more promising result.
Meanwhile bondholders were going without their interest, and costs
of the receivership were mounting up; so that a greater expense than
that of which Mr. Lockwood complained was being incurred by delay.
As for the general mortgage bondholders, they were given a chance at
their old interest whenever the road should earn it, and could fairly
ask no more; while that it was inequitable to ask income bondholders
to accept a reduction to $50 in their annual interest, or holders of
the first series 5s to wait for their interest until liens before
theirs had been satisfied, are conclusions to which few will agree.</p>

<p>In April Messrs. Whelen and William H. Kemble, representing the
Reading consolidated mortgage bondholders, announced that they had
determined not to accept the syndicate plan. Even before this Mr.
Gowen announced that he was organizing a syndicate and would soon be
able to pay off overdue coupons on the general mortgage bonds, and
to prevent any foreclosure under that mortgage.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> It is scarcely
necessary to say that he had a plan of his own. He proposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span> to issue
$100,000,000 4 per cent 70-year consolidated mortgage bonds much as
did the syndicate, part of which should go to redeem the general
mortgage and the floating debt; but second to this he suggested a
cumulative 4 per cent first preferred income bond, to take the place
of the income and consolidated stock under the syndicate plan, and to
be exchanged for the first series 5s, a portion of the second series
5s, and some of the leased canal securities; while finally he planned
a second preferred cumulative 4 per cent income bond, to be exchanged
for those securities down to the deferred income bonds, which under
the syndicate scheme were to receive common stock. The surplus of
income offered by the old general mortgage was to be made good by
first preference bonds. The existing preferred and common stocks were
to remain as they were, and the deferred income obligations were to
remain untouched. Finally, the New Jersey Central was to be retained
in friendly alliance, either under a modified lease at a rental equal
to earnings, or under a special traffic contract.</p>

<p>A comparison of this with the syndicate plan shows that Mr. Gowen
gave up the idea of an assessment; provided for the floating debt
through first preference bonds; swept away three of the four
classes of stock, replacing them by two kinds of income bonds; and
retained the deferred income bonds which the syndicate proposed to
retire. His plan was to be carried through without foreclosure, but
outside of this its advantages are rather difficult to ascertain.
The abandonment of the assessment was distinctly bad; the retention
of the deferred income issue was also bad; the reduction in the
number of kinds of securities tended towards simplicity, but made
impossible the nice distinction of priority on which the syndicate
had relied; while even the replacement of stock by income bonds must
be condemned, substituting as it did an obligation without any very
distinct character of its own for a stock which represented frankly
only a share in the profits of the enterprise. These things were
realized, and the plan received no serious support; but as every plan
so far proposed contributed something to the final product, so Mr.
Gowen’s income bonds and his aversion to foreclosure were not without
influence upon the scheme which ultimately attained success.</p>

<p>The next few months saw active hostilities between Mr. Gowen and
the syndicate; the former taking the position that he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span> never
consent to foreclosure, nor to the placing of the property for five
years under the management of a board of trustees named by his
adversaries.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> To Mr. Garrett, chairman of the reconstruction
trustees, he wrote suggesting that the board should substitute
his plan for that of the syndicate, and that seven reconstruction
trustees should be appointed by the managers of the company to
carry it through. “Upon this being done,” said he, “I will engage
that the plan shall be underwritten by an association of capital
sufficient for the purpose of paying off all the general mortgage
bonds which do not voluntarily accept the new securities provided by
the plan, and I will agree that the financial responsibility of these
subscribers to this fund shall be determined by the presidents of
the Bank of North America, the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ National Bank,
the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance of Lives, etc., and the Union
Trust Company....”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> Mr. Garrett naturally refused.</p>

<p>As in many cases before, the struggle ended in a compromise. The
new agreement was as follows: The syndicate was to be enlarged by
$4,000,000 additional subscriptions, and the reconstruction trustees
increased to thirteen by the addition of certain friends of Mr.
Gowen, one of whom was also to be given place upon the executive
committee. The syndicate plan was to be carried through without
foreclosure, providing sufficient assents could be obtained, and was
to be modified by the substitution of first, second, and third 4 per
cent income bonds for preferred, income, and consolidated 5 per cent
stock. Dividends on the bonds, like those on the stock, were to be
payable from net earnings only; but net earnings were defined as the
profits derived from all sources after paying operating expenses,
taxes, and existing rentals, guarantees and interest charges, <em>but
not fixed charges of the same sort subsequently created</em>. All third
preference bonds issued for convertible bonds were to have the
right to be converted into common stock; and the company was to
have the privilege of increasing the issue, subject for five years
to the approval of the voting trustees. As finally worked out, the
first preference bonds were to be given for assessments; the second
preference for all securities which had been promised income or
consolidated stock; and the third preference for the second series
5s, convertible and debenture bonds, and preferred stock to which
common stock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span> had before been allotted. Somewhat more emphasis was
laid on the possibility of paying off the general mortgage. It was
proposed to reduce the aggregate of rentals and guarantees (exclusive
of the Central of New Jersey, the Schuylkill Navigation Company,
and the Susquehanna Canal Company) to an annual charge of less than
$2,350,000 by direct negotiation with the companies affected. And to
deal directly with the three companies above named upon the basis
of a continuance of their respective leases at rentals involving no
fixed liability beyond the earning power of the leased line, or on
the basis of a surrender of the said leases, and the cancellation
of the traffic agreement with the Schuylkill Navigation Company
for a consideration. The voting trust was to be composed of three
representatives of the syndicate and one friend of Mr. Gowen, which
four should elect a fifth who should be satisfactory both to the
syndicate and to the reconstruction trustees. A united effort was
to be made by the company, the reconstruction trustees, and the
syndicate to secure the immediate appointment of Mr. Austin Corbin as
an additional receiver; and, if Mr. Corbin would take the position
and legally qualify himself to fill it, it was understood that
the presidency of the company would be offered to him. The other
provisions of the syndicate plan were to remain unchanged.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>We have now the reorganization in its final shape, and it will be
interesting to review briefly the gradual way in which this shape
was fashioned. With the company plunged anew into bankruptcy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span> after
a reorganization insufficient to afford any genuine relief, the
proposal was made to fund one-half the general mortgage coupons for
three years and to convert all junior claims into liens on income.
This scheme failed because plainly inadequate to meet the needs of
the situation, and a modified version was presented providing for
an assessment with which to pay the floating debt. The assessment
was approved, but not the plan, and an ensuing scheme supplied an
altogether new method of treatment, whereby on the one hand the
assessment was made more heavy, and on the other two classes of
preferred stock were proposed, with one issue of bonds at 3 per cent.
This plan failed, not so much because of its inadequacy, although it
was inadequate, but because general mortgage bondholders felt that
a 3 per cent bond was less than they could reasonably expect for
their holdings, and insisted on a security with a higher obligatory
rate of interest. The next plan took note of these objections: it
raised the interest on the bonds which it proposed from 3 to 4 per
cent; and in the endeavor to please the junior bondholders as well,
created four classes of preferred stock, by means of which the
relative priority of different issues was carefully and completely
recognized. Assessments were retained, and a guarantee by a syndicate
and a voting trust for five years was suggested. In the discussion
that followed, a new scheme was introduced, which replaced the
preferred stock by two classes of income bonds, and forced the
managers to realize the desire of the old bondholders for some new
security with at least the name of bond. As a result, the syndicate
which had fathered the previous plan consented to substitute for
three of their classes of stock first, second, and third preference
bonds. Meanwhile the fixed charges estimated for the successive plans
steadily decreased. The first looked for $12,911,000, or $14,266,051
as variously reckoned; the second for $14,143,384, or, deducting the
Jersey Central, for $8,223,177; the third for $7,064,830; the fourth
for $6,971,687; and the sixth for $6,583,055. Thus each plan took
over what was most satisfactory in its predecessor; and there was on
the one hand a steady decrease in the fixed charges proposed, and on
the other a continuous effort to discover some plan which might be
satisfactory to all concerned.</p>

<p>That the compromise plan last mentioned succeeded was in part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span> due to
the feeling of all contending parties that concessions must be made;
it was due also to endorsement by the leaders of the more important
interests; and, finally, to an appreciation that the plan was after
all a good one, reducing largely the fixed charges which the company
would have to pay, while depriving no one of a return which, under
the circumstances, he could fairly expect to receive. Mr. Corbin
proved willing to undertake the new responsibilities put upon him. He
was therefore appointed receiver in October, and elected president in
the January following.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to suppose that the plan was
unanimously accepted from the start. The Lockwood Committee of
general mortgage bondholders were prompt in their disapproval,
pronouncing it “unjust, uncertain, and indefinite”; saying that
reorganization under it would be unduly expensive, and that it was
more objectionable than the plans which had preceded it.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> Equally
decided was a small group of capitalists which held a majority of
the first series 5s outstanding, the members of which were said to
have agreed to hold their bonds and to abide the result.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> The
original time limit for deposits expired on March 1, 1887; it was
then extended to March 15, and again to March 31, and deposits of
$110,409,464 out of a total of $117,972,859 were secured. By October
certain other bondholders had been induced to come in, and the
trustees declared the plan operative. Holders of $3,348,000 of first
series 5s stayed out, and forced an arrangement by which they were
practically paid off in cash.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> Arrangements were made with some
of the subsidiary Reading lines, but the lease of the Central of New
Jersey was not renewed. Only odds and ends now remained to be cleared
up, and all through the rest of the year the managers were busy
paying off receivers’ certificates, floating debt, overdue interest,
etc. On January 1, 1888, without formalities, the Reading passed out
of receivers’ hands and into the control of the stockholders.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">With</span> the year 1888 a new period in the history of the Reading began.
The long struggle to bring the company back to solvency was fairly
over, and for the first time in seven years the road saw before it a
chance for genuine prosperity. Unlike the reorganization of 1880–3,
that of 1884–7 succeeded in accomplishing the greater part of the
saving expected of it. According to the plan, interest charges were
to be reduced to $4,233,055;—in 1888 they were $4,516,433, and in
1889 $4,058,139; rentals were not to exceed $2,350,000;—in 1888
they were $2,882,582, and in 1889 $2,842,319. Other payments, it is
true, the necessity for which was passed over by the advocates of the
plan, raised the total which the road was obliged to meet, but did
not prevent a comfortable balance of over $2,000,000 for the Railroad
Company in 1888, and one of $1,444,000 for both Railroad and Coal
Companies combined. During the next few years large sums were spent
in improving the permanent way. By January, 1889, almost the entire
line between New York and Philadelphia had been relaid with 85 and
90 pound rails; grades had been smoothed, bridges strengthened, and
culverts strengthened or rebuilt.</p>

<p>Less satisfactory than the results for the Railroad Company, however,
were those for the Coal &amp; Iron Company. In this case profits of
$654,211 for 1887 turned into a loss of $806,222 for 1888, and in the
following year a weak demand for coal, combined with a high cost of
mining, increased the loss to $974,373. President Corbin felt called
upon to explain that prior to 1886 the deficits of the Coal Company
had been habitually met by inflating the capital account of the
Railroad Company; so that with allowance for this fact the showing
of the companies under his management had been relatively good.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>
In November, 1889, a letter of Mr. Gowen’s was issued, hopeful as
ever, criticising the management for their refusal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span> or neglect to
give authoritative information about actual earnings, but pointing
to the large expense for new coal cars, barges, and collieries, and
explaining the benefit which these would confer.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>The weakened position of its allied company pulled the Reading
down, and prevented it from attaining the secure position which had
seemed in sight. The payment of dividends only increased the general
dissatisfaction. In February, 1889, holders of a considerable amount
of second preference bonds circulated a petition objecting to the
official statement of net earnings applicable to these securities,
and demanded an examination of the books. After an investigation
their expert declared that a 7½ per cent dividend had been earned,
but the bondholders could not induce the company to increase its
distribution. The next year preference bondholders fared even worse.
The managers declared that the surplus over all fixed charges for the
year was barely $100,000, and that no dividends at all upon their
holdings could be paid. Again an investigation was demanded and
accorded, and Mr. Howard Lewis, the expert appointed, reported that
there was applicable to the payment of interest upon first preference
bonds the sum of $90,101, or ⅜ of one per cent; a sum which the
company promptly agreed to pay. Meanwhile even the stockholders
were becoming restless. In June, 1889, a suit was commenced in
Philadelphia, praying that the company’s voting trustees and the
trust under which they acted should be set aside, on the ground that
the trust was to be exercised by five voting trustees, whereas only
four had ever been appointed. Later on the matter was taken up by
London stockholders, and became serious enough to force a concession
of two seats in the board of managers of the company.</p>

<p>There was no question but that the trouble was caused by depression
in the anthracite coal business, for in the carriage of both
passengers and freight the Reading in these years made steady and
substantial gains. In the three years following 1887 the number of
passengers transported increased by 2,400,000 and the earnings from
them by $470,000; while the freight tons moved gained 1,500,000 and
the freight earnings $1,000,000. Only in coal was there a decrease,
which appeared for the Coal &amp; Iron Company in the figures for
sales and gross and net receipts, and for the Railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span> Company
in the earnings from anthracite transported. The result was an
attempt to improve the situation: first, by a combination among
coal producing roads which should raise the selling price of that
commodity; and second, by extension of the railroad into new markets,
whereby an outlet for increased production should be obtained. At
the instigation of Mr. Gowen a syndicate was formed to purchase a
majority of the stock of the Reading Company,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> which bought much
more than 50 per cent, even though Mr. Gowen, the prime mover, died
in the mean time. The existing managers showed no desire to combat
the movement, although the voting power lay entirely in their hands.
In June, 1890, President Corbin resigned, and Mr. A. A. McLeod was
elected in his place.</p>

<p>Mr. McLeod now began a vigorous policy of consolidation and expansion
with the lease for the second time of the Central of New Jersey. He
evaded a New Jersey law which forbade the lease of a domestic to
a foreign corporation by incorporating the Port Reading Railroad
Company and then executing a lease of the Central to this minor
corporation.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> The Port Reading promised 7 per cent on the Central
stock for 999 years, plus one-half the surplus earnings above the
dividend up to 10 per cent, and secured a guarantee of the fulfilment
of these promises from the Reading Railroad proper. Finally, Mr.
McLeod leased the Lehigh Valley to the Reading direct, on a guarantee
of 5 per cent on the stock until May 31, 1892; 6 per cent from that
time until November 30, and 7 per cent thereafter for the rest of
the 999 years. So far as control over the coal supply was concerned
this put the Reading in a very favorable position. The Lehigh Valley
tapped the northern Wyoming field, and the Central of New Jersey
the Mahanoy and Shamokin deposits, and both had access to New York
through New Jersey. The Lehigh, moreover, extended to Buffalo; and
with a line of steamers to Duluth, Milwaukee, and Chicago, promised
to command a large proportion of east-bound traffic in other things
than coal. Figures for the coal industry show that the Reading,
Central, and Lehigh shipped in 1891 53.3 per cent of the total
production of 40,448,000 tons; in 1890 55.5 per cent; and in 1889
57.75 per cent. In addition, control of the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp;
Western was said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span> been acquired by the purchase of a majority
of its stock, which added 15.1 percent more;<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> making a total of
68.4 percent for the year 1891, or sufficient to give a considerable
measure of control over prices. But the terms were severe; quite as
severe as in the case of the leases earlier put through; and though
the Reading was in better shape than it had been five years before,
full interest on its preference bonds was not being paid, and so
long as this continued no outside payments could properly be made.
The subsidiary companies, on the other hand, were not earning the
dividends promised on their stock by nearly one-third of a million
dollars; and it seemed unlikely that sufficient economies could
be secured to cover permanently the deficit. The question could
fairly have been asked whether the Reading had not bought a chance
to contribute an annual sum to the Lehigh Valley and Jersey Central
stockholders; and whether these roads had not deliberately entered
into a contract which was little likely to be carried out. The
justification of the arrangement lay in the control of coal prices
which it made possible, and in the advantages of close traffic
arrangements and connection with both Philadelphia and New York. “The
main reason why the combination failed,” said Mr. I. L. Rice before
the Industrial Commission, “was that there was not an understanding
of the first principles of an operation of that kind, <i>i. e.</i> that
it must reduce prices and not increase them. The anthracite coal
combination was killed because prices were immediately put up....</p>

<p>“Q. Mr. McLeod has testified before this commission that it was his
intention to effect such economies as should be reflected in lower
prices. Do we understand that you criticise the policy in that it did
not so reduce the prices?</p>

<p>“A. He did not do it, no matter what his intention was.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>The situation was, however, as clearly understood by the public as
by the managers themselves. Even before the combination had begun
to carry out its policy, outcry was made, and as prices went up
the agitation became intense. In New Jersey an act to legalize the
combination which passed both houses was vetoed by Governor Abbot on
the ground of the effect upon the price of anthracite coal;<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> and
in June the Attorney-General applied for an injunction to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span> dissolve
the lease of the New Jersey Central to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading,
alleging that the tripartite agreement between these companies and
the Philadelphia &amp; Reading was illegal. The court granted a temporary
injunction,<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> which it continued in August to a final hearing,
with conditions to make it more effective.</p>

<p>Prices did not go down, and in October Attorney-General Stockton of
New Jersey again appeared before Chancellor McGill. He now charged
the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, the Central, and the Port Reading with
having conspired to advance the price of coal in defiance of the
order of the court, and asked for the appointment of a receiver to
enforce the former decree, and to restrain the company from further
using the New Jersey railroads for carrying any coal until the
advanced price should have been reduced.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> The officers denied
the allegations, but the Chancellor sustained the Attorney-General
on every point; and only the official announcement of the abrogation
of the lease prevented the granting of the order.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> The lease of
the Lehigh Valley fared better. In a suit brought by M. H. Arnot,
a stockholder in the Lehigh Valley, Judge Metzger of the Court
of Common Pleas held that the Reading and Lehigh Valley were not
parallel and competing lines in the sense contemplated by the law;
and that mere incidental competition between branches or spurs of two
systems would not prevent the consolidation of their main lines.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
So much then of the original programme was allowed to stand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the search for new markets, the Reading had stretched
into New England, having chosen that territory in the hope of
increasing its tonnage without a desperate struggle with its
neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> The most available subject for control was the Boston
&amp; Maine, which reached from Northampton and Boston, Massachusetts,
to Portland, Maine, was independent of the large trunk lines, and
had a profitable local business of its own. Purchases of this
railroad’s stock were quietly made; and in October, 1892, the public
was surprised by the election of Mr. McLeod to the presidency,
although, as it subsequently transpired, an actual majority of Boston
&amp; Maine stock was not secured.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> It was obvious that nothing
could be gained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span> from the new arrangement unless the gap between
the Reading and the Boston &amp; Maine should be filled; and so, even
before the purchase of stock in the latter was begun, the lease of
the Poughkeepsie Bridge across the Hudson was put through,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>
and a controlling interest was bought in the stock of the Central,
New England &amp; Western. The last-named road extended from Hartford,
Connecticut across the Poughkeepsie Bridge to Campbell Hall,
145½ miles, and connected at this point with the Pennsylvania,
Poughkeepsie &amp; Boston, a road controlled in the interest of the
Reading. This completed a through route from Philadelphia to
Hartford. Later the Central, New England &amp; Western Railroad Company
and the Poughkeepsie Bridge Railroad Company were consolidated
into the Philadelphia, Reading &amp; New England, with Mr. McLeod as
president;<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> and a controlling interest was purchased in the New
York &amp; New England Railroad, which ran from Poughkeepsie via Hartford
and Providence to Boston,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> and afforded another entrance into
New England. All this involved a very great extension of the Reading
system. The lease of the Lehigh Valley had connected it with Buffalo;
the subsequent consolidations brought it into every New England
state, and gave it a total mileage of, roughly, 5000 miles.</p>

<p>Danger lay in two directions. First, it was possible that even the
union of the Lehigh, Jersey Central, and the Reading might fail to
secure a profit for the mining end of the business, and second, the
financing of the New England deals might be so conducted as to put
the parent road into a very difficult situation.</p>

<p>Both these contingencies occurred. The early termination of the
Jersey Central lease weakened the control of the Reading over
prices, while the severity of the winter of 1893, though assisting
to maintain prices, so increased the expense of operating the mines
that earnings fell below fixed charges for the three months ending
February 28, 1893, by the amounts of $933,443 for the Railroad
Company and $468,362 for the Coal &amp; Iron Company. Moreover, losses of
$616,351 accrued during the same time under the Lehigh Valley lease,
and were met by the Reading, contrary to expectation, and contrary
to the express provisions of the mortgage by which its income bonds
were secured. In order to accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span> the New England extensions
shares were bought on margin by President McLeod personally with
collateral in part supplied by himself, in part taken from the
treasury of the company, and consisting of general mortgage,
collateral trust, and income bonds. “On or about September 22,” said
Mr. I. L. Rice, a representative of the bondholders, who had been
examining the books, “Mr. McLeod entered into certain individual
stock transactions which resulted in the purchase of 24,036 shares
of the stock of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad Company and 32,000
shares of the stock of the New York &amp; New England Railroad Company.
On October 15, 1892, he withdrew from the control of the company,
without having previously obtained the authority of the board of
managers therefor, and without expressing the purpose for which he
intended to use the securities, 30,000 general mortgage bonds of
the company, which as afterwards appeared were used at that time
as margins in the transaction. He subsequently withdrew from the
control of the company in the same manner and for the same purpose,
between October 28 and December 1, 1892, $713,000 of collateral trust
bonds, and $99,000 third preference bonds. No reference whatever is
made to these stock transactions on the books of the company except
the mention of the withdrawal of securities against the personal
receipt of the president, nor are they referred to on the minutes
of the board of managers prior to December 24, 1892. On the latter
date the board of managers in a resolution approved the transaction,
calling for the use of $613,000 of the company’s collateral, and
indemnifying Mr. McLeod for advances made for the same purpose to
the extent of $400,000. On January 17, 1893, Mr. McLeod deposited
$250,000 additional collateral trust bonds as margin, making a total
of $963,000. On February 15 Mr. McLeod directed that the account be
transferred from his individual name to that of the company’s.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>Leaving aside the matter of the propriety of Mr. McLeod’s action, it
is plain that the method which he employed was an extremely expensive
one, in that it raised the necessary cash by temporary loans at high
rates from brokers in New York and Philadelphia instead of by the
sale of stocks or bonds, or by the use of funds which the company
might have had on hand. According to President Harris, the average
charges paid on the floating debt in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span> 1892, a large portion of which
had been accumulated in these operations, was 9 per cent. If the
control over the corporations acquired had been desired for temporary
reasons the operation would have been a stock speculation pure and
simple, and the Reading would have trusted to the possible rise in
price of the securities purchased to cancel the expense of advances
to the brokers who did the buying; but in this case the control was
designed to be permanent, not temporary, and Mr. McLeod expected
results which could be obtained only after a series of years.</p>

<p>This brings us to the beginning of 1893. Mr. McLeod had succeeded
in carrying out his plans for a combination of coal producing roads
and for the extension of the Reading into New England, but had seen
his first project bitterly attacked, and his second scheme become a
burden because of the insufficient funds behind it. Matters came to a
head in February with an attempt to borrow on $10,000,000 collateral
trust bonds. Speyer &amp; Co. accepted the issue, but the Drexels refused
to handle it, and began to sell the company’s securities at any
price.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Quotations dropped from 46¾ to 40⅝ on February 17, and
continued to fall the two succeeding days, reaching 28 on February
20. On this last day application was made to the United States
Circuit Court in Philadelphia, and Messrs. McLeod, Wilbur, and Paxon
were appointed receivers. “I am very sorry,” said President McLeod,
“that we were driven to the necessity for a receivership, but it
was the only thing to do. Our credit was attacked in a way which
made it impossible for us to meet our obligations, and we had the
receivership established before the property was further injured....
The trouble was brought about by the fact that we were doing an
enormous business on a small capital, and when this attack was made
... it hurt our credit so that we could not borrow money.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Lack
of capital was the repeated cry of the management. At a later date
Mr. McLeod again said, “When I leased the Lehigh Valley and the
Jersey Central and took over their coal operations ... I found that
I had $13,000,000 invested in coal and in carrying the customers
of the companies. The Reading did not have that much capital, and
I had to borrow $8,000,000 of that $13,000,000. Then the panic of
1893 came on. I had arranged to fund that $8,000,000 of floating
debt by selling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span> securities, etc., giving me a working capital of
$17,500,000, but the parties who were to furnish the money had six
months in which to do it, and on account of that panic coming on
before I could get the money, there was nothing in the world for me
to do except to put the Reading in the hands of the receivers to save
its securities.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> The statements concerning the lack of capital
were a true explanation though not an excuse. Money had been tied up
in unsalable coal, acquired not only by the leases of the Lehigh and
Central, but also by purchases from independent operators<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> and by
production during the current year;<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> while whatever spare funds
the Reading had been able to provide had been put into New England
securities at high prices to carry out the road’s ambitious plans.
In the mean time the large purchases on margin made a fall in the
price of Reading securities of especial moment; and, as Mr. McLeod
explained, it proved impossible to liquidate the floating debt. The
failure of 1893, then, was caused less by a continued inability to
meet fixed charges than by an undue expansion of operations such as
has ruined many a solvent firm. Reading’s venture in the coal fields
had not proved a success, but the loss had not been sufficient to
ruin it within a year; its New England extensions had not brought
all the results desired, but they had not had a fair trial; the true
cause for the failure was the attempt to accomplish by means of stock
speculation and temporary loans at high rates more than the road
could do out of its legitimate resources, with the intent on the one
hand to raise the price of coal and on the other to secure fresh
markets for the sale thereof.</p>

<p>After the failure the first impulse of the bondholders was to
denounce Mr. McLeod. A meeting of European creditors in London chose
a committee to represent them and solicited McLeod’s removal from the
receivership on the “serious ground” that the administration of their
property should not any longer be jeopardized by remaining under the
control of an official who had already brought it into its existing
difficulties. A New York general mortgage bondholders’ committee
decided to act in a similar direction, and Mr. Drexel represented to
the president that he should resign for the sake of the future of
the company.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> Mr. McLeod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span> unwillingly gave way. For successor
the board of managers chose Mr. Joseph S. Harris, a man of long
experience in railroad affairs. Mr. Harris had been for many years
connected with the Lehigh Valley system, and was the same man who,
it will be remembered, had evaluated the Reading coal properties in
1880. Following his election as president he was appointed receiver
in the place of Mr. McLeod.</p>

<p>The receivers’ statement came out in March and announced a floating
debt of $18,472,828, against which were held reported assets to the
amount of $15,779,784; but of these last $4,985,276 were in the shape
of coal, and $8,861,065 consisted of the items “due for freight,”
“tolls due from connecting roads,” “bills receivable,” “cash,” etc.,
a large part of which was probably of little worth. Both the current
liabilities and the current assets are instructive, and show that on
the one hand Mr. McLeod’s stock operations had involved the company
in heavy obligations to his brokers, and that on the other losses in
the coal business had necessitated current advances to branch lines
from which it was impossible to get return. It appears, for instance,
that the Coal &amp; Iron Company had been unable to pay the sums charged
it for freight, and while the full amounts had been nevertheless
included in reported earnings, the actual result had been a swelling
of bills receivable by debts which the Railroad Company was quite
unable to collect.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>The general lines of the policy to be pursued were now sufficiently
clear; the more pressing claims were to be met by the issue of
receivers’ certificates, expenses were to be cut down, payments under
leases were to be amicably reduced where possible, holdings of Boston
&amp; Maine stock were to be sold, and on the side of the bondholders the
various interests were to agree on some scheme for raising cash and
for improving the general condition of the property. There was need
for some reduction of fixed charges, but not for such radical cuts as
in 1880 or in 1884.</p>

<p>The receivers and managers carried out their part of the work first.
Application was made in March, and again in June, for permission
to issue certificates in settlement of the most urgent claims.
In May Mr. McLeod resigned the presidency of the Boston &amp; Maine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
after a large part of the Reading’s holdings had been sold, and the
same month President Harris inaugurated a policy of retrenchment
by the retirement of four out of the five vice-presidents which
the Reading had been accustomed to maintain. In July the receivers
obtained permission to dissolve the agreement with the Pennsylvania,
Poughkeepsie &amp; Boston Railroad, and in August the appointment of a
separate receiver for the Philadelphia, Reading &amp; New England marked,
except for the minor matter of the Poughkeepsie Bridge, the final
abandonment of New England extension. Meanwhile an arrangement had
been made with the Lehigh Valley, whereby the payments under the
lease were reduced for two years from 7 per cent to 5 per cent, on
condition that the Reading should make extra payments at the end of
that time if the Lehigh proved to have earned more than 10 per cent
in the interval; and permission had been obtained from the Circuit
Court to surrender the possession and operation of the Eastern &amp;
Amboy Railroad and the Lehigh Valley Terminal Railroad, both lines
belonging to the Lehigh Valley in the state of New Jersey. The Lehigh
lease, even as modified, aroused much opposition from bondholders,
who rightly maintained that payments under it constituted a diversion
of funds which should have gone to the creditors of the Reading
proper. Suit was begun before the Circuit Court, and on August 8,
1893, a formal abrogation was obtained. This incidentally caused the
resignation of Mr. Wilbur, president of the Lehigh Valley, from his
position as receiver of the Reading, and the appointment of Mr. J.
Lowber Welsh in his place.</p>

<p>The more complicated task of the bondholders was at first undertaken
by two committees: one for the general mortgage bondholders, of
which Mr. J. Edward Simmons was chairman; and one for the income
bondholders, led by Mr. George Coppell. Three demands were at once
made: first, that Mr. McLeod retire from the receivership; second,
that the lease of the Lehigh Valley be abrogated; and third, that the
books of the company be examined by a railroad accountant. The first
and second points were complied with, though not altogether because
of the insistence of the committees, and in the end the third was
also granted, and Mr. Stephen Little was set to work.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
On May 27, 1893, the managers of the company brought forward
a reorganization plan, which estimated the floating debt at
$19,991,941, and proposed to cover it by the issue of $22,000,000
collateral trust bonds at 95. These bonds were to be redeemable
any time before maturity at 110, and the trustee was authorized
“to apply the surplus income or the proceeds of sales ... of any
of the securities pledged until 1898, and thereafter so much as
might be determined from time to time by the Railroad Company, to
the purchase of the said bonds at the best price obtainable, or, if
necessary, to draw the same for redemption.” General mortgage and
first, second, and third preference bonds were to be entitled to
subscribe to the amount of 10 per cent of their holdings; deferred
income bonds to 4 per cent; and stockholders to 24 per cent; while
besides the $22,000,000 mentioned, $2,000,000 additional bonds were
to be issued each year for working capital and for the acquisition
of real and personal property. General mortgage bondholders were to
fund their coupons to and including January 1, 1898, and to receive
an equivalent amount of coupon trust certificates. The rental under
the Lehigh Valley lease was to be reduced, and the Reading stock
was to be transferred for seven years to a voting trust composed of
Joseph S. Harris, E. P. Wilbur, Thomas McKean, and two others to be
afterwards named.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> Assents of 90 per cent of the general mortgage
bondholders and of 60 per cent of the stockholders were required
by the 21st of June to make the plan effective, and a syndicate
was pledged to carry out the provisions if such assents should be
obtained.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<p>An issue of collateral bonds, a reduction in the Lehigh rental, a
funding of coupons, and a voting trust: these were the propositions
which President Harris and his associates presented for the
consideration of the bondholders. There was to be no disturbance of
existing securities, no assessment, not even a reduction of fixed
charges except as these were lightened by the lowering of rentals
and by the payment of the floating debt. It is to be presumed that
the attempt to extend the Reading into New England was not to be
continued, for no provision was made for the purchase of the shares
of the New England roads hitherto held on margin, and in fact large
sales of Boston &amp; Maine stock had already taken place; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span> no formal
mention of the deal was made. The lease of the Lehigh Valley was
to be continued in the hope of better times, while the reduction
of rental which the plan required had already taken place. Under
ordinary circumstances any plan such as the one outlined would have
been quite futile. Where the failure of a road is due to deep-seated
causes the remedy must be fundamental; and when a piling up of
indebtedness is due to inability to pay fixed charges the situation
must be met by a reduction of those charges even though a foreclosure
sale be a necessary preliminary. In the present case matters were
somewhat different: bankruptcy had come, not from a long-continued
drain, but from a rapid diffusion of resources in an attempt to
accomplish more than the finances of the road would permit; and a
change of policy was the thing most urgently required. But this again
was not a question with which a reorganization plan had to deal,
except in so far as such a plan might smooth the difficulties which
lay in the way; and any scheme which should restore to the company
the collateral imperilled in its rash campaign, fund the floating
debt at a reasonable rate of interest, and give the management a
chance to start again, was worthy of serious consideration. It may be
observed, however, that granting all of the above, the plan before
us did not go far enough. The extensions due to President McLeod had
been in the heart of the coal regions, as well as in New England, and
one of the most important of these, the Lehigh Valley, the managers
proposed to retain. This policy, it may be said, was of very doubtful
wisdom. The attempt to monopolize the production of anthracite
coal had already been fruitful of disaster, and the possession of
the Lehigh would have constituted a continual temptation to future
purchases; while it was far from certain that even under the reduced
rental the road could have been made to pay. What the Reading needed
was a period of quiet attention to its own business, undisturbed by
meddling in the business of other people; an attention which would
be sure to result in increased economies, and was the true remedy
for the lack of prosperity in the coal industry which had driven
Mr. McLeod on his wild career. It is to this latter judgment that
we must in the end conform. The plan of President Harris was not so
inadequate as might at first appear; it accomplished much that needed
to be accomplished, and it gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span> an opportunity to the management of
the road to retrace many of the steps of the previous two years; but
on the other hand, it did not embrace the chance to free the Reading
from all its mistaken enterprises, and passed by an occasion which
could only again occur after much suffering and loss.</p>

<p>Discussion turned, however, on other features. In a circular to
securityholders in June, President Harris said: “My deliberate
opinion is that the assistance asked for by the proposed plan ... is
none too great, and that there is a good probability that if it is
afforded and the plan is carried out prudent and careful management
may prevent the recurrence of such a crisis. My judgment is that
the securityholders will make a very serious mistake if they do not
accept the relief offered them, for I see no probability that the
necessary assistance can hereafter be obtained except upon much more
onerous terms. I strongly advise that the plan shall be promptly
accepted.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> “We cannot but regard these terms as very easy,”
said the <cite>Financial Chronicle</cite>. “To be sure a new collateral trust
mortgage for $30,000,000, bearing 6 per cent, is to be created,
but the greater part of this goes to take up floating debt and
other existing obligations, and will involve no increase in fixed
charges....”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> On the other hand, it was objected that the plan
was formed entirely in the interest of the floating debt holders,
income bondholders, and stockholders; and that the management under
the arrangement would have the power to pay dividends upon the income
bonds, while at the same time the coupons on the 4 per cent mortgage
bonds were being funded.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> In an editorial urging foreclosure
proceedings the London <cite>Standard</cite> said: “That [foreclosure] will
prevent holders of pledged collaterals from getting a market for
their securities, and, at the same time, bring a good many doubtful
matters connected with the finances of the company into the light of
day. It should also tend to make the ‘floating debt’ swindle less
popular with eminent American financiers. At present they pile these
debts up in the full assurance that they can easily arrange matters
so as to put them, when funded, before existing mortgages. It is for
the Reading general mortgage bondholders to act promptly for their
own interests.”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> Finally, it was objected that the plan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span> was in
the interest of the McLeod management, and that the voting trust
was to be a McLeod organization, which would either whitewash the
ex-president’s operations, or by keeping them in the background would
virtually outlaw them.</p>

<p>The plan failed because the time allowed for deposits was too short.
In spite of the objections raised 31,356 general mortgage bonds and
411,218 shares of stock were deposited in twenty-five days, and it
was maintained that additional securities would surely be obtained to
make up the percentages required. The managers alleged, however, that
extension was impracticable, and announced that the scheme could not
go through.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>The year following this attempt at rehabilitation was full of the
struggles of different interests, each jealous of any concession
and working devotedly for its own hand. Prominent at this time was
Mr. I. L. Rice, the same gentleman who has before been quoted in
connection with Mr. McLeod’s operations in New England stocks. Mr.
Rice had been a member of the syndicate which had put Mr. McLeod
into the presidency, and had served as foreign representative of the
company during his régime. He had been instrumental in forming the
anthracite coal combination, and at the time of the Reading failure
had been in England raising money to finance the coal holdings
then acquired.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Returning from Europe upon the appointment of
receivers, he examined the Reading books with the results which have
been noticed, and now appeared as the active enemy of everything
connected with Mr. McLeod, even to the receivers who had succeeded
him. In May, 1893, he resigned the seat which he had held on the
Reading board, on the ground that the management had condoned the use
by Mr. McLeod of the company’s securities in carrying on his private
and personal speculations; in September he resigned from the income
bondholders’ committee, and attacked in a circular the McLeod régime
and the succeeding receivership;<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> and in December he applied
for the removal of the receivers, alleging that they had grossly
neglected their duties to the stockholders, and had ignored the
financial transactions of Mr. McLeod prior to their appointment.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
In spite of his hostility to the existing régime, Mr. Rice hoped
to rehabilitate the company without foreclosure or, indeed, formal
reorganization. The action of others was inspired by a less
optimistic view. The original suit on which receivers had been
appointed had been brought by one Thomas C. Platt; but as early
as March Alfred Sully and A. B. Rand of New York, and John Lowrie
of London, holders of first and second preference income bonds,
petitioned to intervene. In July Judge Dallas dismissed the Lowrie
suit, but the petition was renewed in September, alleging that Mr.
Platt “did not file his bill in good faith on his own behalf, and
on behalf of all other holders of bonds, but at the request and for
the benefit and protection of the men who were then managers of
the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company and the Philadelphia &amp;
Reading Coal &amp; Iron Company, and that the suit was not being pressed
with due diligence.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>All this time the receivers had been busy on a plan, which they
presented in January, 1894. By leaving out of consideration some
$5,000,000 of car trusts they arrived at the figure of $12,500,000
for the floating debt. This they proposed to cover by the issue of
$6,000,000 in 6 per cent ten-year trust certificates, based on the
stock of coal on hand, and by $10,000,000 in 5 per cent collateral
trust bonds then in the treasury of the Reading Company. They hoped
that a balance of $2,500,000 would then remain available for working
capital or other purposes. General mortgage coupons were to be funded
for five years, although the receivers planned to have a syndicate
formed to purchase at par for cash the coupons as they matured,
giving to the bondholders in each case the choice between receiving
money or coupon trust certificates for the interest due. There was
to be no formal reorganization, no cuts in charges, nothing but
a provision for the floating debt and for a temporary funding of
interest payments; and this was the more feasible because the Lehigh
Valley lease had been by this time abrogated and the New England
extensions definitely abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> It will be remembered that
to the plan of May, 1893, it had been objected that the provisions
contrived to bring in the floating debt ahead of previously existing
liens, and were a premium on a kind of financial juggling too common
among American railroads. This plan, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span> avoided a new issue
of bonds, and used only what the treasury already possessed. The
coal notes were obviously unobjectionable, and served at the same
time to utilize the unsalable stock which the management had earlier
accumulated. If their value should prove small the loss would fall
on the holders of the floating debt and not on the owners of the
general mortgage bonds; while the return to the company was assured
by arrangement with Drexel &amp; Co., Brown Bros. &amp; Co., and J. Lowber
Welsh on the one hand, and the Finance Company of Pennsylvania on
the other. On the whole this plan was gentle even to tenderness
with the creditors of the road, and its failure revealed clearly
the bondholders’ state of mind. The holders of the general mortgage
refused to fund their coupons for five years, they refused to fund
them for two years, and they insisted that foreclosure proceedings
should be instituted unless they should receive immediate payment
of their interest. “In view of this,” the receivers were forced
to remark, “it would be idle for [us] to continue the efforts to
readjust the affairs of the company....”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> The trouble with the
receivers’ scheme was not that it demanded large concessions,—much
larger had been asked and granted in 1887,—but that the general
mortgage bondholders felt that on the one hand the road was very
nearly earning fixed charges, so that in the contingency of a
foreclosure sale their interests would be reasonably safe; and on
the other that a demand for concessions so soon after a complete
reorganization of the property was an irritant which might well be
resented even at the risk of some pecuniary loss. Fortunately the
assent of the bondholders was not necessary to the issue of the coal
trust notes, and the receivers executed them under the authority of
the court, practically as proposed.</p>

<p>In April, 1894, Mr. Simmons, chairman of the old general mortgage
bondholders’ committee, resigned his position, and Mr. Fitzgerald,
president of the Mercantile Trust Company, was chosen to succeed him.
The committee presently issued a notice which, after reviewing its
early activity, went on to say that it had believed it prudent to
give the receivers every opportunity to familiarize themselves with
the affairs of the company, but that in its judgment the time had
come for action to enforce the rights of the bondholders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span> under the
mortgage.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> In May, 1894, a new general mortgage committee was
organized, with Mr. F. P. Olcott as chairman, designed not directly
to oppose the Fitzgerald Committee, but to hasten the rehabilitation
of the property. The committee prepared a bondholders’ agreement
calling for the deposit of general mortgage bonds, and in a statement
of their position said: “Difficulties in the way of a foreclosure and
reorganization thereafter are exaggerated; if any danger is wrought
by such foreclosure it will fall upon the junior securities and not
upon us.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Lastly, at this time, there was a committee headed by
Mr. Earle, president of the Finance Company of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The first matured suggestion after the failure of the receivers’
plan appeared in what was known as the Olcott-Earle Agreement,
published on September 25, 1894, which seems to have been in many
respects a revival of that scheme. It proposed to cover the floating
debt by the sale to securityholders of $10,000,000 collateral trust
bonds, heretofore held in the treasury, and to fund coupons on the
general mortgage 4s for five years. A syndicate agreed to advance
$9,000,000, or as much thereof as might be needed, to buy the
coupons as they should mature. The stock was to be held and voted
by the reorganization committee until all the money advanced by the
syndicate should have been repaid; that is, till June, 1898; a second
syndicate guaranteed the sale of the collateral bonds at 70; and the
preferred bondholders were asked to forego any claims for interest
until all the general mortgage coupons should have been retired and
cancelled. Certain other details are of interest. The collateral
bond issue was to be taken up by the preferred bondholders and
stockholders, each individual subscribing to 10 per cent of the par
value of his holdings; but the bondholder might, if he preferred, pay
3 per cent of the par value of the securities he owned and receive
nothing, instead of paying 10 per cent and getting a collateral bond.
Securityholders were given 60 days in which to assent, and if at the
end of that time the number of assents did not amount to practically
all the interests involved, the committee proposed to reorganize by
foreclosure for the benefit only of those who had assented to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
plan; while for the future the committee was to provide by agreement
with the railroad company that the latter should call an annual
meeting of general and income mortgage bondholders and stockholders,
at which bondholders as well as stockholders should vote in
proportion to the par value of their holdings.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that the source of relief sought by this plan
was precisely that of the receivers’ plan earlier described. Certain
changes, however, of considerable importance were introduced.
The subscriptions to the collateral issue were made distinctly
obligatory, and an alternate assessment was provided; greater use
was made of syndicate assistance; some voting power was given to the
bonds; and a voting trust was added to ensure permanency of control
to the designers of the reorganization till their work should be
complete. On the whole there were still few concessions to creditors,
and indeed could be few. Ten coupons of the general mortgage were
to be funded, though it was made easy for the bondholder to get
cash if he preferred it; the provisions concerning subscriptions
to the collateral bonds were rather more burdensome than before;
and the voting trust, while redounding to the ultimate advantage of
creditors, was only indirectly a concession to their demands. The
grant of voting power to the bondholders would have been a great
concession, but the wording of the clause was vague and probably
little practical effect would have ensued. As in the previous plans,
no particular attention was paid to the reduction of fixed charges.</p>

<p>So much for the provisions of the plan. It was a hopeful innovation
for the suggestions it contained to come from holders of general
mortgage bonds, and seemed to give some evidence of a change of
heart; especially since the Olcott Committee did secure the assent
of a larger proportion of the issue than had accepted either of
the propositions before brought forward. The Fitzgerald Committee
strenuously protested, still insisting on the advisability of
foreclosure; and further objections came from Mr. Rice and from
the Hartshorne Committee. Nevertheless, the general mortgage as a
whole gave its consent, and ultimate shipwreck was due only to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
abstention of the income mortgage bonds.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> It is not surprising
that the income bondholders should have felt that the plan had little
in it for them. They had been given no voice in its making,—their
wishes had at no time been regarded. During the whole reorganization
the question had been of the terms to which the general mortgage
bondholders would consent, and the only sign of the existence of
junior liens had been an occasional fearful inquiry as to what would
become of them under foreclosure; until now the combination of a
voting trust with the expenses of a syndicate reorganization, and
an assessment upon them and upon the stock, touched the limit which
they would stand. There was, moreover, at this time no question of
the wiping out of the value of their holdings. The preamble to the
Olcott-Earle plan stated that the annual charges were $10,477,560 and
that the net earnings for 1891 had been $10,977,398; thus showing
that something was left for the junior securities even after the
payment of interest on all prior and general mortgage liens. It
seemed also barely possible that the difficulties of a foreclosure,
with the danger under the laws of Pennsylvania of losing the coal
properties of the company, might secure better terms for the holders
of junior obligations in case they should withhold their assent.</p>

<p>Early in January, 1895, the following official notice was issued:
“The plan of readjustment, dated October 1, 1894, has not been
assented to by a sufficient number of income bondholders and
stockholders to make the same effective. The committee now hold over
a majority of the general mortgage bonds, and have, in accordance
with the bondholders’ agreement of May 7, 1894, and their circular
of October 1, 1894, notified the trustees of the general mortgage
to bring suit for the foreclosure thereof ... as expeditiously
as possible.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> Suit for foreclosure was brought March 2 in
accordance with the announcement, and the Junior Securities
Protective Committee, an organization with purposes indicated by its
name, was allowed to intervene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Meanwhile the Fitzgerald and Olcott committees together prepared and
brought forward the final reorganization scheme. The conditions now
differed from those with which any previous plan had been confronted,
in that it was no longer necessary to seek for as little change as
possible, and a broader, more radical reorganization was in point.
“Unless,” began the scheme, “the managers shall decide to proceed
without foreclosure or sale, the properties of the existing Reading
companies will be sold and successor companies will be organized
under the laws of Pennsylvania, and the stock and securities of these
successor companies will be vested in a new company formed, or to be
formed, under the laws of Pennsylvania or of some other state.”</p>

<p>There were to be issued:</p>

<table summary="New bond and stock issues">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">General mortgage 100-year 4 per cent gold bonds,</td>
    <td class="tdr">$114,000,000</td>
    <td> </td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Non-cumulative, 4 per cent first preferred stock (subject to an increase of $21,000,000),</td>

    <td class="tdr">70,000,000</td>
    <td> </td></tr>
</table>

<p>If at any time dividends of 4 per cent should have been paid on
the first preferred stock for two successive years the company
might convert the second preferred stock at par, one-half into
first preferred and one-half into common stock. These new issues
were ultimately to retire all outstanding securities, to provide
for expenses of reorganization, and to go for new construction,
additions, betterments, etc., in the succeeding years. Since,
however, it was obviously impossible to cancel prior liens before
maturity, sufficient general mortgage bonds ($44,550,000) were
reserved from immediate issue to retire these when they should fall
due. This left new general mortgage bonds with four classes of stock
against old general mortgage bonds with three classes of preferred
bonds, common stock, and deferred incomes; and, as might be expected,
new general mortgage 4s were given for the old general mortgage,
second preferred and common stock went for preference bonds, and new
common stock for old common stock and deferred income bonds. Certain
cash payments were made on the general mortgage, and $4,000,000 of
the new issue were sold to a syndicate; but on the whole we may say
that the prior liens and general mortgage bondholders occupied the
same position in the new company which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span> had occupied in the
old; that the income bondholders exchanged a bond with a lien on
income for a stock with a right to dividends; and that the floating
debt, syndicate, and other expenses were given equal rights with the
general mortgage.</p>

<p>No additional mortgage was to be put upon the property, nor was the
amount of the first preferred stock to be increased, except with the
consent, in each instance, of the holders of a majority of the whole
amount of each class of preferred stock, given at a meeting of the
stockholders called for that purpose, and with the consent of the
holders of a majority of such part of the common stock as should
be represented at such meeting, the holders of each class of stock
voting separately; neither was the amount of the second preferred
stock to be increased, except in a similar way. These careful clauses
made some provision for future capital requirements necessary which
should be independent of the consent of the stockholders at any
time; and $20,000,000 general mortgage bonds were accordingly set
aside, to be issued in amounts not greater than $1,500,000 in any one
year for future construction, equipment, and the like. Additional
general mortgage bonds were provided to retire Philadelphia &amp; Reading
Terminal and Coal &amp; Iron Company bonds up to the sum of $21,000,000.</p>

<p>The floating debt, estimated at $25,150,000, was provided for in part
by assessment, and in part by the sale of securities to the syndicate
for cash; 20 per cent being levied on first, second, and third
preference income bonds, 20 per cent on the stock, and 4 per cent on
the deferred incomes; while the syndicate agreed to take $4,000,000
of the new general mortgage bonds and $8,000,000 of the new first
preferred stock. The assessment was expected to yield $20,862,289,
and the syndicate to contribute in cash $7,300,000; leaving an
estimated cash balance of $3,000,000. In addition, the syndicate
(Messrs. J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., J. Kennedy Tod &amp; Co., Hallgarten &amp;
Co., and A. Iselin &amp; Co.) undertook to underwrite the payment of
the assessments on the income bonds and stock, and to guarantee
the extension or payment of the improvement mortgage and Coal &amp;
Iron Company bonds, most of which were to mature in the following
two years. No great reduction of fixed charges was of course to
be expected. The cancellation of the floating debt effected,
nevertheless, a certain saving, so that charges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span> for the future were
estimated at $9,300,000 as against net earnings of $9,839,971 in
1894; while the refunding or extension of maturing bonds was looked
to for a reduction of $500,000.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>It is plain that this plan favored the general mortgage bondholders
to the last degree, and admitted them to the reorganized company
with absolutely no sacrifice save that of the addition of $4,000,000
to the total general mortgage issue. They funded no coupons, they
suffered no diminution of interest and no shaving of principal; they
paid no assessment; and as an additional protection to them, the
provision was inserted that all classes of stock of the new company,
except such number as might be disposed of to qualify directors, were
to be voted by three voting trustees, of whom J. P. Morgan and F. P.
Olcott were designated in the plan. It has seldom happened in any
reorganization that a mortgage similar to the general mortgage in
this case has been able to take and hold so strong a position.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
The secret lay in the fact that the road had been earning the
interest on the general mortgage bonds; and that under these
circumstances no interest or combination of interests could force
the holders to accept less than payment in full of all their claims.
The situation could never have arisen in the earlier reorganization;
it could never have occurred where a reduction in annual payments
was required for the salvation of the property, or even where the
amount of cash to be raised to pay the floating debt was so large
that junior securityholders would have relinquished their holdings
rather than pay the necessary assessments. In this case none of these
conditions existed, and all the burden was thrown on the holders of
junior mortgages and stock. It must be remembered, also, that though
in ordinary cases the difference between the income bonds which the
old first and second preference bondholders surrendered and the
preferred stock which they received would not have been very great,
yet here the provisions of the old income mortgage, which forbade the
deduction from net earnings of any interest on bonds subsequently
created until its interest should have been paid, rendered the loss
more serious.</p>

<p>To sum up, the holders of junior securities and stock paid the
expenses of reorganization, paid the floating debt, lost what
right they had to interest before the settlement of interest on
subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span> created claims, and got only stock, and for the most
part second preferred or common stock at that. The general mortgage
bondholders got new 4 per cent bonds, plus 12 per cent, or 2 per cent
in cash, had no greater interest charges ahead of them, and without
paying any assessment or making any concession, except to allow the
immediate increase of the amount of their issue by $4,000,000, and
thereafter by $1,500,000 per year, secured a lien on the assets of
the company; a privilege which was, moreover, extended to undeposited
as well as to deposited bonds. The company itself was dissolved, but
the new corporation which took over its assets enjoyed, with slightly
decreased charges, freedom from the old floating debt and from the
extensions and combinations which had caused the floating debt of the
old management, and seemed besides a strong financial backing.</p>

<p>In May, 1896, Judge Atchison of Philadelphia signed the decree for
the foreclosure and sale of the property of both the Railroad and the
Coal &amp; Iron Companies, and on September 23 the sale took place, C. H.
Coster, of J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., and Francis Lynde Stetson paying an
aggregate of $20,500,000 for the whole estate.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> The sale ended
the life of the old Reading charter; and in view of the constitution
adopted for the state of Pennsylvania in 1871, which forbade any
railroad owning more than 30,000 acres of coal land, some device had
to be sought whereby the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad and the
Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Companies could hold together.
Diligent search revealed the existence of the “National Company,” a
corporation chartered in 1871 by special act of the legislature of
Pennsylvania at the very time when the new constitution was under
consideration. This company, originally the Excelsior Enterprise
Company, had power “to purchase, improve, use, and dispose of
property to contractors and others and for other purposes,” with
privileges fully as broad, it was said, as those enjoyed by the
Reading before foreclosure.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> The National Company now changed
its name to the Reading Company, called a special meeting, increased
its stock to the amount required by the plan of reorganization, and,
jointly with the Coal &amp; Iron Company, authorized a mortgage to secure
bonds up to a possible amount of $135,000,000; to be secured on the
property of both companies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span> including the stock and bonds of the
Railway Company. Meanwhile the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway Company
had been organized to succeed to the property and franchises of the
old Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> with a capital
stock of $20,000,000 in $50 shares. The charter of the Coal &amp; Iron
Company was preserved in spite of the foreclosure sale.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> The next
step was for the Reading Company to exchange its bonds and stock for
the general mortgage bonds and stock of the two minor companies in
the proportions already agreed upon, and to deposit the securities
so obtained in its treasury; leaving the prior liens the only direct
obligations of either company in the hands of the public. This meant,
of course, absolute control of both companies by the Reading Company;
and in the future, when the prior liens should mature, it was to mean
the replacement of all outstanding obligations by the obligations of
the holding company. Both the Railway and the Coal &amp; Iron Companies
retained their separate organizations; the belief was that there was
no merger which might be attacked before the courts; that it only
happened that one corporate individual had invested in both Railroad
and Coal Company shares and proposed to vote this stock, as was
lawful, to further the policies of which it approved.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Representatives of the reorganization managers laid an elaborate
defence of the legality of these operations before Attorney-General
McCormick of Pennsylvania, and on January 2 secured an opinion
confirming the validity of the charter of the Reading Company. “After
due consideration,” said Mr. McCormick, “I reach the conclusion,
most reluctantly, that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot now
successfully attack the chartered rights of the Reading Company....
My view of the whole matter is that the charter of the company
authorized it to do the kind of business in which it engaged prior to
January 1, 1874, which business was of the same general character as
that in which it proposes to engage for the purpose of controlling
the stocks of the Railway Company and the Coal &amp; Iron Company.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>Like the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Erie, the Reading has benefited
largely from the favorable business conditions of the last decade.
The combined income of the three Reading companies has grown from
$48,422,971 in 1898 to $95,715,088 in 1907.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Earnings on the
Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway alone are now nearly as great as the
combined income of the three companies at the earlier date. Net
receipts were $13,586,710 in 1898 and $29,190,316 in 1907; and the
surplus over all payments rose from $1,376,420 to $8,741,454 between
those years. It is important to notice that this showing does not
depend primarily upon the anthracite business. Not only has the
carriage of general merchandise increased until it affords to the
railway a return almost equal to the earnings on coal, but in the
coal business itself bituminous has assumed an importance nearly as
great as that of its harder rival. The Coal &amp; Iron Company still
concerns itself almost entirely with anthracite, and has accordingly
been more affected by special causes. The strike of the miners in
September and October, 1900, and again from May to October, 1902,
checked the growth in production for a time; but the increased
demand for domestic consumption has made possible an increase in
output from 4,849,002 tons in 1897 to 10,034,713 in 1907. Increasing
business has stimulated improvements. Over $15,300,000 have been
withdrawn from income by the Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span> &amp; Reading Railway Company
for this purpose between 1896 and 1907; and over $10,000,000 have
been invested from earnings by the Coal &amp; Iron Company during the
same time in colliery improvements alone. Maintenance charges have
been ample. Whereas $1300 to $1500 per mile of single main track are
sufficient for normal repairs upon a trunk line, the Philadelphia
&amp; Reading Railway has spent over $2600 per mile of line for the
last seven years, and over $1700 for the three years preceding. As
much as $73 has been spent in a single year for average maintenance
per freight car, $609 in maintenance per passenger car, and $3244
in maintenance per locomotive. In consequence of these repairs
and of renewals upon a considerable scale, the average value of
all locomotives has increased between December 1, 1896, and June
30, 1906, from $4906 to $8393; the average value of freight cars
producing revenue from $383 to $622; the average value of steam
colliers and tugs from $41,533 to $55,451; and the average value of
barges from $7930 to $21,074. The average freight train load was 194
tons in 1897 and 403 tons in 1907. Ton-mileage has increased during
the period 159 per cent and freight train mileage only 27 per cent.</p>

<p>It is true that no great sums have been spent from capital account.
$5,137,825 in car trust certificates were outstanding on June 30,
1907, and $5,608,000 in general mortgage bonds have been sold and
the proceeds invested principally in new equipment, but this is all.
Improvements have been made mainly from earnings, and fixed charges
have not had to be increased. In fact, the voting trustees stated
at the expiration of their trusteeship in 1904 that, eliminating
the fixed charges created since December 1, 1896, on account of the
acquisition of additional properties and interest upon the additional
mortgage bonds issued for the purchase of equipment, the fixed
charges of the Reading system were $1,018,065 less for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1904, than they were for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 1896.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>It thus comes about that the finances of the Reading, while not
as secure as could be desired, are yet in better shape than they
have been for thirty years. Fixed charges, taxes, and operating
expenses<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span> took 86 per cent of gross income in 1907, but a
decline of nearly $12,000,000 in net earnings must precede a default
on any bonds outstanding. To this margin should be added the
considerable amount by which maintenance expenses now surpass normal
figures. An initial dividend was declared on the Reading Company
first preferred stock in August, 1900; on its second preferred in
October, 1903; and on its common in February, 1905. Four per cent is
now being paid upon all classes of stock.</p>

<p>Large amounts of Reading stock are held by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
and by the Lake Shore. The Reading has again bought control of
the Central of New Jersey, and owns besides a steamship line and
something under 500 miles in other subsidiary roads. Its large
earnings, its troubles with its mine employees, its influence
over the supply of a necessity of life, and the possibility of
discrimination which its control of both railroad and coal properties
affords, have made it a target for legislative attack from state and
national governments. Action was begun by the Department of Justice
in 1907 to dissolve the merger between the Reading and the Central
of New Jersey. In June of the previous year the so-called “commodity
clause” of the Hepburn Act forbade any railroad company to transport
in interstate commerce any article except timber and the manufactured
products thereof which it should have produced, or in which it should
have any interest, except those products necessary and intended
for its own use in its business as common carrier. The legality of
the Reading’s position in these matters is yet to be decided by
the courts. The student may well doubt whether legislative action
will ever succeed in preventing the common ownership of the Reading
railroad and mining interests. What is more probable is that a strict
governmental control will come to be imposed. Against this proper
development no appeal to legal technicalities will avail.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">At</span> the present time there are in the South five great railway
systems: the Atlantic Coast Line; the Seaboard Air Line; the Southern
Railway; the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad; and the Illinois
Central Railroad, which cover, in the order named, the territory
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>The backbone of the Southern Railway is formed by the old Richmond
&amp; Danville and East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia companies: of
which the first formerly stretched with its subsidiary lines from
Washington and Richmond on the north to Atlanta, Georgia, and
Greenville, Mississippi, on the south and west; and the second
reached from Bristol, Tennessee, in a great half circle to the ocean
at Brunswick, Georgia, and by means of the Mobile &amp; Birmingham
straight to the Gulf at Mobile.</p>

<p>The Richmond &amp; Danville was opened in 1856 between Richmond and
Danville, Virginia. It was largely aided by the state of Virginia.
Three-fifths of its stock were owned by the state in 1867, there
was a state loan of $400,000, and a state guarantee of $200,000
besides.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> In natural consequence the state elected three of the
six directors. It was not long, however, before the state was able
to relieve itself of a large part of its investment. On the 31st
of August, 1871, all of the state shares were taken over by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Pennsylvania Railroad Company.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> The money sunk in the company’s
bonds still remained. From Danville the Richmond &amp; Danville steadily
pushed south in the years following 1856. Under the leadership
of the Pennsylvania it became its ambition to open direct rail
communication from the great Northern cities to the heart of North
and South Carolina and Georgia. To obtain a ninety-mile extension to
Charlotte the company leased the North Carolina Railroad, 223 miles
in length.<a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> To get into Atlanta it allied itself with the Atlanta
&amp; Richmond Air Line Company, projected to construct a line between
Atlanta and Charlotte.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> In 1878 it bought a controlling interest
in the Charlotte, Columbia &amp; Augusta Railroad and secured entrance to
the latter city.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> The Pennsylvania aided the new enterprise by
advances from time to time, and when the current liabilities became
unmanageable took $1,000,000 of a new refunding mortgage.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railroad had been
established to the west of the Richmond &amp; Danville, in the heart of
the southern Appalachians.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> This company was a consolidation in
1869 of the East Tennessee &amp; Virginia Railroad, from Bristol, on the
boundary between Virginia and Tennessee, to Knoxville, Tennessee; and
the East Tennessee &amp; Georgia Railroad, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to
Dalton, Georgia. Both roads were aided by the state of Tennessee. In
1870, however, the new company extinguished its debt to the state
by the payment of $4,117,761 in state bonds. Not long after the
completion of its line from Bristol to Dalton, the East Tennessee
fell under the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which already
dominated its neighbor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span> to the east. To facilitate the control and
to unify the interests of the Pennsylvania south of Washington a
“Southern Railway Security Company” was formed, with a capital
of $5,000,000. This company was entrusted with a majority of the
stock of the Richmond &amp; Danville and of the East Tennessee. It also
controlled the Coast Line railroads from Richmond to Charleston,
and the Memphis &amp; Charleston from Chattanooga to Memphis.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
Unfortunately the financial results of the combination were
disappointing. Of the subsidiary roads the East Tennessee managed
to pay at least 3 per cent on its capital stock from 1872 to 1876;
but the Richmond &amp; Danville paid nothing, the Coast Lines nothing,
and the Memphis &amp; Charleston barely earned the 3 per cent guaranteed
under its lease. In 1873, therefore, a special meeting was held at
the office of the Southern Railway Security Company to consider the
propriety of making sale of certain properties of the company.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
In 1874 the lease of the Memphis &amp; Charleston was surrendered,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a>
and in 1876 the bulk of the securities held, outside of the Richmond
&amp; Danville stock, were disposed of.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p>The retirement of the Southern Railway Security Company marked the
beginning of the withdrawal of the Pennsylvania from investment in
the South. For the rest, it left the lines north of South Carolina
in three main competing groups. There were the Coast Lines from
Richmond south, the Richmond &amp; Danville, and the East Tennessee,
Virginia &amp; Georgia properties. And stretching from west to east was
the Memphis &amp; Charleston, which was already in financial difficulties
of a serious nature. All three of these groups were now thrown
upon their own resources; and two of them, at least, took vigorous
measures in self-protection. The policy of the East Tennessee was
the most aggressive. Shut up in the narrow valley between the
Clinch and the Great Smoky Mountains, and flanked by hostile roads,
it conceived it to be necessary for it to acquire connections to
the south, to the east, and to the west. Accordingly, it leased
the Memphis &amp; Charleston in 1877 and obtained an outlet upon the
Mississippi River.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span> 1878 it bought the Georgia Southern
and the Selma, Rome &amp; Dalton and provided itself with a line as
far south as the Flint River in Alabama.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> In 1881 it bought
the Alabama Central, extending some 96 miles west from Selma. The
same year it secured control of the Macon &amp; Brunswick in Georgia,
and began construction from Macon to Rome to complete a line to
the South Atlantic coast.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> In the north it made an alliance
with the Norfolk &amp; Western, which opened that company’s line from
Bristol to Norfolk,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> and arranged with the Louisville &amp; Nashville
and the Kentucky Central for construction to a connection at the
Kentucky-Tennessee state line which should open to it the business of
the Central West.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>The Richmond &amp; Danville fell under the control of a group of
capitalists who already controlled the Atlantic Coast lines and
held an interest in the East Tennessee, and who now bought the
24,000 shares of Danville stock still held by the Pennsylvania
Railroad.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> Like its rival, it enlarged its system. It leased
the Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Air Line in 1881,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> with certain minor
roads in the Carolinas and in Georgia. In 1882, under the charter of
the Georgia Pacific, it began construction westward from Atlanta to
the Mississippi. It did not stretch out, as did the East Tennessee,
but it secured a very complete control of the territory between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Richmond in the north and Augusta, Savannah, and Atlanta in the
south. In 1881, also, the Richmond &amp; Danville took a step destined
to have important consequences. Since it desired to acquire certain
railroads, and since its charter allowed it to hold stock in none
but connecting lines, it caused to be incorporated a so-called
Richmond &amp; West Point Terminal Railway &amp; Warehouse Company, with
authority to acquire stocks and bonds of railroad companies in North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi, and other states. This company increased its stock by
October, 1881, to $3,000,000; of which the Richmond &amp; Danville then
owned $1,510,000. The most important acquisition which it made at the
time was the Virginia Midland Railway, from Alexandria, Virginia, to
Danville; but other additions were to follow.</p>

<p>The independent action of the Danville and East Tennessee companies
was followed by a new consolidation which reunited most of the lines
dominated by the old Security Company. In response to queries in
August, 1883, Mr. Calvin S. Brice admitted that a syndicate in which
he was interested had bought control of the Richmond &amp; Danville.</p>

<p>“We have secured,” said he, “about 28,000 of the 50,000 shares of
stock issued by the Richmond &amp; Danville Company. Our syndicate
controls, besides our new purchase, the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp;
Georgia Railway and the Chesapeake &amp; York River line of steamers that
ply between West Point, on the Chesapeake, and Baltimore, and has
close traffic arrangements with the Clyde steamers, which run between
New York and Philadelphia and all Southern points. Our purpose is to
confine all our railroad and steamship lines under one management,
and to equip and operate the system in the best possible manner.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p>It appears from this statement that the capitalists who controlled
the East Tennessee now again consolidated with the leading interests
of the Richmond &amp; Danville and lines east, albeit changes in
personnel and transfers of holdings occurred. Return to the old
combination was made desirable by the more intimate connection
of the two groups of roads. The Western North Carolina had been
opened across the mountains of North Carolina in 1882. This had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
made practicable the diversion of the western traffic of the East
Tennessee from the Norfolk &amp; Western to the Richmond &amp; Danville;
a traffic which the northern connections of the East Tennessee
promised largely to increase. Consolidation was doubtless also
prompted by the desire to save the East Tennessee from serious
financial difficulty which threatened it. It had become apparent
that this company, at least, had severely taxed its strength in the
rapid extension of mileage which had followed 1876. Before that
time its position had been secure. It had possessed a monopoly of
the somewhat limited local traffic between Chattanooga and Bristol,
and had formed part of the most direct route between New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and towns in Tennessee,
Northern Alabama, and Mississippi. Its extensions had changed the
situation. They had brought it into touch with the Mississippi
River and the Atlantic Ocean, and had increased its fighting power;
but they had also endowed it at large cost with a group of poorly
equipped, unprofitable lines located in a keenly competitive
territory. The Selma, Rome &amp; Dalton had been purchased just after a
foreclosure sale. The Macon &amp; Brunswick had never been able to earn
much more than working expenses. The Alabama Central had not seen
fit to publish its financial figures after 1878, while the Memphis &amp;
Charleston, as we have seen, had turned to the East Tennessee only to
escape bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The East Tennessee had hoped to make profitable the lines which
it had so rapidly acquired. Unfortunately the company was poorly
equipped for such a task. Its finance had been extravagant. In 1875,
on 269 miles of lines there had been $7317 in stock and $15,620 in
bonds per mile. In 1883 the mortgage bonds and car trusts outstanding
per mile owned amounted to $23,444, the income bonds to $15,404, and
the capital stock to $41,079. A grand total of $79,927 as compared
with the $22,937 of eight years earlier, and an average of almost
$100,000 in securities per mile of new line acquired! Ninety-nine
per cent of net income was being absorbed in paying interest on all
classes of securities, although maintenance figures were kept as low
as $630 per mile of line. This large volume of stocks and bonds made
improvement from earnings impossible, and prevented conservative
management by taking from the stockholders any chance of dividends,
and by reducing the quotations of common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span> stock to less than $5
per share. And though in some respects the location of the system
was good, the route which it offered to much of its business was
indirect, the competition which it had to meet was severe, and its
Atlantic terminal, Brunswick, was of small importance compared with
the thriving cities of Savannah and Norfolk. The result was a failure
to secure the gains from consolidation which had been expected.
Surplus earnings were continuously small, and current bills were left
to run; until by 1883 the floating debt had become so large that an
issue of $1,200,000 in debenture bonds was required to take care of
it.</p>

<p>The failure of the East Tennessee to weld its connections into an
efficient transportation system left it helpless in face of the panic
of 1884. Earnings fell off in that year, a directors’ committee was
appointed,<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> and the resulting report revealed a plain inability
on the part of the company to meet its charges.</p>

<p>“This will leave,” said the committee, “an annual deficit of
$350,000, to which must be added a total of $1,000,000 required by
the general manager for steel rails, iron bridges, and other needed
improvements.</p>

<p>“The sums for covering these expenses should not be raised by
temporary loans, as this would not relieve the company of its
embarrassments nor place its finances upon a sound footing. It cannot
be raised by an additional mortgage, on account of the provisions
of the mortgage securing the income bonds. It must and can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
raised from a funding of coupons which shall leave the earnings of
the company sufficiently free to meet the demands upon them. The
committee therefore recommends:</p>

<p>(1) “That the holders of the consolidated 5 per cent bonds be asked
to fund four coupons, being those maturing January and July 1, 1885,
and January and July 1, 1886, by depositing said four coupons with
the Central Trust Company of New York, as trustee, and receiving
instead the company’s funded coupon bond dated July 1, 1885, and
bearing 6 per cent interest per annum from that date, ... which bond
shall run ten years from its date and be redeemable at the pleasure
of the company at par and accrued interest after three years, on
three months’ notice; such funded coupon bond to be secured by the
coupons so deposited, the lien of which will be in all respects
preserved.</p>

<p>“The total extensions under this clause would be $1,467,400.</p>

<p>(2) “That the holders of the $2,000,000 of the Cincinnati &amp; Georgia
Division first mortgage 6 per cent bonds be asked to fund four
coupons, ... being those maturing March and September 1, 1885, and
March and September 1, 1886, ... and accepting in lieu thereof a
funded coupon bond ... dated September 1, 1885.</p>

<p>“The total amount extended under this clause would be $240,000.</p>

<p>(3) “That the holders of the debentures be asked to extend for ten
years such of the debentures as fall due during the years 1885 and
1886, and to accept similar debentures running from five to ten
years, for the interest....</p>

<p>“The total amount extended under this clause would be $373,200.</p>

<p>(4) “That an arrangement be made with the holders of the car trust
certificates of the company, series A, for an extension for ten years
of all the payments of principal falling due in 1885 and 1886, being
$100,000 in each year.</p>

<p>“The total amount extended under this clause would be $200,000.”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>The committee had an apology to offer for the state in which the
company was placed. “The actual cost of the 190 miles of the new
roads constructed by the company has largely exceeded,” said
they, “the estimated cost. The physical condition of the roads
purchased by the company necessitated the expenditure of large sums
in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span> improvement of roadway and track; the construction and
reconstruction of bridge masonry and bridge superstructure. The
facilities for the conduct of the company’s business were entirely
inadequate to the requirements of its increasing traffic and had to
be enlarged. Unfortunately the company did not fully provide for
these expenditures, and the shrinkage of the value of its securities
greatly aggravated the evil.” This much was very true. In its
criticism of existing facilities the committee was on sure ground.
In its suggestions for relief it was less well advised. It seems
to have felt that the East Tennessee’s difficulties were due to a
temporary inability to raise cash for the improvement of its roadbed
and equipment, and that the suspension of certain charges for a few
years would allow the expenditure of liberal sums from income, ensure
the improvement of the road, and bring about a condition of permanent
prosperity. The truth was that the East Tennessee was in too bad a
shape to be reëstablished by such means. The heavily burdened and
physically defective lines which made up the system were past being
restored from income even with the aid of a funding of a few years’
coupons. They required a definitive surrender of portions of the
claims against them, extensive new charges to capital account, and
a correspondingly complete reconstruction of their whole operating
plant.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> The practical service which the committee rendered was
not in suggesting an adequate remedy for existing troubles, but in
making plain how serious these troubles were. So imminent, in fact,
did they show collapse to be, that the management determined to
forestall hostile action by themselves asking for the appointment of
a receiver; and on January 7 the Circuit Court appointed Henry Fink
to that position.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> The committee’s funding scheme fell of its
own weight.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span> The decrease in the earnings of the company, a truer
appreciation of its condition, and, it may be surmised, the influence
of New York banking houses, forced it to make room for a thorough
plan of financial reconstruction.</p>

<p>Action looking toward reorganization of the East Tennessee,
Virginia &amp; Georgia began with the year 1886. In January Mr. Nelson
Robinson,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> who had held proxies for a controlling stock interest
at the previous election, returned from Europe; and after a
conference with certain large bondholders agreed with them to draft
a plan for the reorganization of the property. A reorganization
committee was chosen from members of large banking firms,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>
meetings were held, and in the first part of February, 1886, a scheme
was put forth. This plan comprised the following points:</p>

<p>(1) Reduction of fixed charges;</p>

<p>(2) Exchange of new bonds and preferred stock for old bonds;</p>

<p>(3) Assessment on the junior securities;</p>

<p>(4) Foreclosure.</p>

<p>Foreclosure was to take place under the consolidated mortgage. A
new 5 per cent seventy-year consolidated mortgage was then to be
created. Enough of the bonds under this mortgage were to be reserved
to retire the liens prior to the existing consolidated mortgage as
they should mature, and the balance was to be used for taking up the
outstanding consolidated mortgage bonds, the Cincinnati &amp; Georgia
division bonds, and the ten-year debentures. It was estimated that
the exchanges would reduce the annual interest charge from $1,757,460
to $994,737.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> This necessitated considerable demands upon old
securityholders. Thus the old consolidated mortgage bonds bearing
5 per cent received only 60 per cent of their face value in new
consolidated bonds with the same rate of interest; and the old 6 per
cent Cincinnati &amp; Georgia division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span> bonds received only 48 per cent
in consols, besides suffering a decrease in interest rate from 6 to
5 per cent. The difference was made up by the allowance of preferred
stock, to which, moreover, was given the right for five years to
elect a majority of the board of directors, unless before that time
the new company should have paid out of its net earnings 5 per cent
dividends on such preferred stock for two full successive years. To
the Cincinnati &amp; Georgia division bonds were given 62 per cent in
new first preferred besides the 48 per cent in bonds,—a total of
110 per cent; upon which the yield in prosperous times might exactly
equal the yield on the securities which they surrendered. To the
consolidated bonds were given 50 per cent in new first preferred,
making possible a total return greater than that which they had
formerly enjoyed. For the debentures was made the same provision as
for the divisional bonds. In order that net earnings might go first
of all to the prior liens and to the above securities, new second
preferred and common stock was issued for the benefit of the old
income bonds and stock. Of these the income bonds received 100 per
cent in new second preferred; while the old preferred received 100
per cent and the old common stock 40 per cent in new common. Only
in return for their assessments did the income bonds receive first
preferred stock, and even for their assessment the common stock took
second preferred. Cash assessments were 5 per cent on the income
mortgage and 6 per cent on the new common stock. This was expected
to yield $2,475,000, which, with a surplus of new securities in
the treasury of $1,534,000, was thought sufficient to liquidate
outstanding car trusts and to provide the company with a fund
available for future use.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></p>

<p>The plan may be criticised in some respects. It made no adequate
provision for future capital requirements. Two millions and a half of
cash and two millions of securities were considerable sums in hand,
but of these over half a million was in the form of stock, and from
the rest had to be deducted at least a million and a half for the
liquidation of car trusts. This left, it is true, enough for existing
needs,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> but it did not allow for constantly recurring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span> and
legitimate demands for improvements out of capital in future years.
Moreover, the securities given for the consolidated, the Cincinnati
&amp; Georgia division, and the debenture bonds exceeded by 10 per cent
the nominal value of the bonds retired by them. But on the whole the
reorganization plan was an excellent attempt to solve a difficult
problem. It proceeded on a sound principle, it laid the burden on the
proper parties, it avoided a funding of current liabilities, and even
in respect to the volume of securities outstanding it accomplished
a much needed reform by wiping out 60 per cent of the almost
worthless common stock.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> It was accordingly accepted by the
securityholders. On March 18, the reorganization committee obtained
a decree of sale.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> By May 1, practically all the consolidated
and income bonds, with a majority of the preferred stock, had
assented;<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> and on May 25, 1886, the East Tennessee, Virginia
&amp; Georgia Railroad was sold for $10,250,000 to a representative
of the reorganization committee. Previous to this the opposition
committee, which had been formed by the minority stockholders, had
disbanded.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> The final step was the organization of the East
Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span> which on July 1 took over
the title to the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railroad and
branches, a controlling interest in the stock of the Knoxville &amp;
Ohio, and a controlling interest in the stock of the Memphis &amp;
Charleston Railroad Company.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>During this time the Richmond &amp; Danville had not been standing
still. It will be remembered that in 1883 the capitalists who
dominated the East Tennessee and the Coast Lines had purchased a
controlling interest in this company, with the purpose, according
to Mr. Brice, of confining all their railroad and steamship lines
under one management and of operating the system in the best possible
manner. These gentlemen had found the earnings of the Richmond &amp;
Danville sufficiently unsatisfactory and the need for improvements
sufficiently great to lead them to pass the interest on its debenture
bonds in October, 1883. The net earnings for 1882, out of which this
dividend would have been paid, they found had been fully taken up by
the fixed charges and the expenses for new equipment and betterments.
The net earnings for 1883 they believed sure to show large gains,
but still not likely to be equal to necessary expenditures.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a>
Strict economy was to be the order of the day. In the three previous
years the company had accumulated a large floating debt. This the new
management reduced more than one-half by the end of 1885. The funded
debt it allowed to increase largely, but the earnings it managed
somewhat to improve. In general, however, it secured no very striking
gains. Union in interest with the East Tennessee and the Coast Lines
modified the severity of competition, but the panic of 1884 checked
business, and the real saving in operating cost was very slight.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>In their search for means to reduce expenses the owners of the
Richmond &amp; Danville came across the Richmond &amp; West Point Terminal
Company. By 1884 this company was in peaceful possession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span> of 1815.8
miles of railroad, which included all the important branches of
the Richmond &amp; Danville except the North Carolina Railroad, from
Goldsboro to Charlotte, and the Atlanta &amp; Charlotte Air Line, from
Charlotte to Atlanta. It had been obliged to issue notes to retire
its floating debt in 1883,<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> but had no earnings apart from
dividends on the stock which it held, and no expenses other than its
cost of administration and the interest on the notes above mentioned
and on its floating debt. There was a possibility, nevertheless, that
the maintenance of the company involved the Richmond &amp; Danville in
unnecessary outlay, and caused a certain loss of efficiency through
indirectness of control. The Terminal Company had originally been
necessary because the Richmond &amp; Danville could by its charter hold
stock in none but connecting lines. By 1885 this prohibition had been
removed, and there was open an opportunity to consolidate the system.</p>

<p>Early in 1886 the directors of the Richmond &amp; Danville appointed
a committee to report a plan of union with the Richmond &amp; West
Point Terminal.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Apparently this committee recommended the
elimination of the Terminal Company; for in April it was known that
the Richmond &amp; Danville was trying to buy from the Terminal the stock
of certain of the more important branches which it had formerly
controlled.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> In that month the Richmond &amp; Danville leased the
Virginia Midland Railway<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> and the Western North Carolina; in
May it took over the Charlotte, Columbia &amp; Augusta and the Columbia
&amp; Greenville; in June the Northeastern of Georgia; and in October
the Washington, Ohio &amp; Western, or a total of 1483 miles out of the
1839 held by the central corporation.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> At the same time the
Richmond &amp; Danville transferred into its own treasury $13,617,400
in stock and bonds of subsidiary companies, giving in return 25,000
shares of the Terminal’s own stock, and a guarantee of the Virginia
Midland’s general mortgage bonds. This done, the Danville Railroad
threw the rest of its holdings of Terminal stock upon the market;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
where they were bought by investors who knew nothing of the above
transactions. The operation left the Terminal high and dry. It was
of no further use to the Richmond &amp; Danville, for that company had
made arrangements with its branch lines direct; and it could not
launch upon an independent existence, because the greater part of its
mileage was in its rival’s hands.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the small Terminal holders it so happened that men
of large wealth and resourcefulness were interested with them. Under
the leadership of these capitalists the Terminal Company began in
its turn the purchase of Danville stock. It may have been that the
East Tennessee group who had acquired a majority in 1883 had meantime
parted with their holdings, or members of that syndicate may have
sold in 1886 to take advantage of a favorable price.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> At any
rate, 25,000 shares were rapidly acquired, and the control of the
company obtained. This done the new Terminal interests turned to the
East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia. Negotiations were at once begun,
and culminated in an agreement in 1887 by which the Brice-Thomas
group sold 65,000 shares of East Tennessee first preferred for
$4,000,000 in cash and 50,000 shares of new Terminal common. Since
the Tennessee first preferred elected a majority of the directors
this ensured control. At the same time the Richmond Terminal provided
for its floating debt, and for the purchase of the balance of the
Richmond &amp; Danville shares outstanding.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Thus was the Richmond &amp; West Point Terminal Company saved, and the
principal railroads east and west of the southern Appalachians still
kept under common control. The new grouping was weaker than the old,
however, in that it did not include the Coast Line railroads. It was
also imperfect as regards the nature of the control possessed over
the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia. It has been said that the
Richmond Terminal held a majority of the first preferred stock of
this latter road.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> By the terms of the Tennessee reorganization
of 1886 this stock was to have the right for five years to elect a
majority of the directors, unless before that time it should have
received 5 per cent dividends for two successive years. This gave
control to the Terminal Company; but it plainly made a control
precarious which rested, as this did, on ownership of first preferred
alone. In 1887 4 per cent was paid in dividends, and in 1888 5 per
cent. In 1888, accordingly, a lease was drawn up, and the Richmond &amp;
Danville took the operation of the road for ninety-nine years. For
four years it agreed to pay over 33⅓ per cent of the gross earnings;
for five years more 35 per cent; and so on until 37 per cent
should be reached. And, further, it guaranteed that the percentage
allowed should be sufficient to pay all the East Tennessee’s fixed
charges, including 5 per cent annually on the first preferred shares
outstanding.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>It cannot be denied that the ethics of the Tennessee’s lease were
questionable. The East Tennessee reorganization had invested the
first preferred stock of that company with temporary authority. To
use this to bind the property for years to come was neither fair to
the other stockholders, nor in accordance with the spirit of the
reorganization plan. We need not, therefore, be surprised at the
prompt application for an injunction and for the appointment of a
receiver which occurred.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> In a circular to the second preferred
and junior stockholders the opponents of the lease urged that its
consummation would constitute an abuse of power on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span> part of the
existing board; that it was entirely in the interests of the first
preferred stockholders; that under no circumstances could the junior
stockholders derive any income from the lease; that it failed to
provide other safeguards and was in many respects improvident and
imperfect. In one suit before State Chancellor Gibson at Knoxville,
Tennessee, emphasis was laid on the statutory prohibition of the
consolidation of competing lines. In another, petition was even
made that the holders of the first preferred stock be enjoined from
electing a majority of the board of directors at the approaching
meeting.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> Chancellor Gibson handed down two vigorous opinions.
He refused to enjoin the voting of the first preferred stock, on
the ground that the plaintiffs had been in possession for two years
of stock certificates which bore on their face the conditions and
agreements under which they were issued, and that the complaint was
not justified, either in law or equity.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> But he held that the
East Tennessee had no power under its charter to lease its road as
it had done; that the combination of the East Tennessee and the
Richmond &amp; Danville was forbidden by the law of Tennessee against the
consolidation of competing lines; and that similar prohibitions in
the laws and constitution of Georgia were so stringent as to imperil
the East Tennessee’s charter in case the lease should be carried
through.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> This effectually checked the lease. After Chancellor
Gibson’s first opinion the East Tennessee election had been held and
the arrangement with the Richmond &amp; Danville approved.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> After
his second the lease was cancelled, and the management of the East
Tennessee restored to its own officers.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> The Richmond Terminal
was still left in control of the property. It was forced, however, to
secure a majority of all the East Tennessee stock outstanding if it
wished to make its control permanent, and it was prevented from using
the power temporarily given a section of the stock to bring about a
ninety-nine-year arrangement distasteful to the majority.</p>

<p>Master of the Richmond &amp; Danville, the East Tennessee, and their
allied lines, the Richmond Terminal now took one step further; it
acquired the Central Railroad &amp; Banking Company of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span> Georgia. The
importance of this was very great. The Central Company owned the
most considerable of the lines in Georgia and Eastern Alabama. It
stretched from Savannah and Port Royal on the Atlantic coast to
Spartanburg, South Carolina, on the north; to Atlanta, Birmingham,
and Montgomery on the west; and to Albany, Georgia, and to Columbia
on the south. Its system had been formed by a consolidation in 1872
of the Central Railroad from Savannah to Macon with the Macon &amp;
Western from Macon to Atlanta,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> and was compact, ably managed,
and profitable. Previous to June, 1847, the Central Railroad Company
had paid seven dividends aggregating 10.68 per cent. From June,
1847, to June, 1889, the Central Railroad and the Central Railroad &amp;
Banking Company which succeeded it, had paid seventy-five dividends
aggregating 337.5 per cent,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> besides stock dividends of 8 per
cent in 1854 and 12 per cent in 1861, and a dividend of 40 per cent
in certificates of indebtedness in 1881. It was paying 8 per cent
in 1888 when the Richmond &amp; Danville was paying 5, and the East
Tennessee was congratulating itself on the 5 per cent which it was
able to turn over to its first preferred stock.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p>So fruitful a piece of railroad property was naturally looked on as
desirable, especially since its acquisition was to free the East
Tennessee from one of its most dangerous competitors. From a traffic
point of view, nevertheless, the advantages of a consolidation were
doubtful. The local business of the Central was likely to be little
increased by a merger. The through business was in danger of being
decreased. The Central lines ran on the whole east and west. It was
to their interest to carry freight from Georgia, Alabama, and the
West to Savannah, and thence to send it north by way of the Ocean
Steamship Company which they controlled, and from which they obtained
in 1889 one-fifth of their total net earnings; while the Richmond
Terminal’s interest was to send<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span> this traffic north by land so as
to secure for its own railroads the long haul. The advantages to
the Terminal of a union depended on the price at which the Central
Railroad could be acquired. The purchase was made, and the price
was a high one. And this price was paid, it was freely charged, not
in pursuance of an honest though mistaken judgment, but in order
to allow a large personal gain to individual capitalists who were
interested in both the Central and the Terminal Companies.</p>

<p>Among the most prominent owners of Central of Georgia stock at this
time were members of the Logan-Rice group of financiers, who had
begun to accumulate holdings at least as early as 1886. The average
price which these parties paid was later estimated at 130, and
their holdings were apparently secured with a view to resale at a
higher figure. At any rate, when 40,000 shares had been purchased,
a double operation was put through. The shares bought were turned
over, with $400,000 cash, to a newly formed “Georgia Company,” and
for them $4,000,000 in 5 per cent trust bonds and $12,000,000 in
Georgia Company stock were received in exchange. And, second, a
vigorous campaign was entered upon to secure control of the Richmond
Terminal. Sully resigned the Terminal presidency in April. For his
vacant place the Logan-Rice people offered General Alexander of the
Central of Georgia, and the Terminal management supported John H.
Inman. The struggle which ensued was most extraordinary. The existing
board of directors charged the Central group with trying to unload
their Georgia Company’s stock upon the Terminal system; and the
Logan-Rice party insinuated that the purchase of the East Tennessee
Railroad had been the occasion of fraudulent profits to the Terminal
directors.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
“We understand,” declared the directors, “that a majority of the
names thus far proposed by the parties soliciting proxies to be cast
for directors and president of this company are gentlemen who are
well known to be the owners of a majority of the stock of the Georgia
Company, which owns railroads whose business and interests are at
all points of our system in competition with and antagonistic to the
business and interests of this Company; any diversion of traffic,
or exercise of influence favorable to the Georgia Company at the
numerous competitive points would work incalculable injury to your
prosperity.... If on the other hand the preponderance of the Georgia
Company’s interest in this Company should result in a sale to and
purchase by your Company of the Georgia Company stock owned by these
gentlemen, it would necessitate the issue of many millions of your
common stock, or some kind of obligation taking precedence of that
stock, the effect of which upon the value of your property you are
fully competent to judge.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>The general election of the Terminal was held on May 31, and Mr.
Inman was elected president for the remainder of the unexpired
term.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> The Rice party was apparently overwhelmingly defeated. In
reality its activity and the presence of its friends in the councils
of the victors resulted in the successful sale of the Georgia Company
securities. In October, 1888, little over five months after the
directors’ circular of April 6, the Richmond Terminal took over
the Georgia Company stock at $35 a share and allowed its owners to
withdraw successfully from their speculation. Subsequently it also
took the Georgia Company bonds from the bankers who had purchased
them.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> This left Inman, Hollins, and the rest a profit of $60
a share on their original investment. It meant for the Richmond
Terminal a direct annual loss which there was very little prospect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
of making good. To provide for the $4,000,000 in bonds and the
120,000 shares of stock acquired, this latter issued approximately
$8,200,000 of 5 per cent collateral bonds bearing an annual interest
charge of $410,000. Now both the stock and the $4,000,000 of bonds
were a lien on 40,000 shares of Central of Georgia stock and depended
altogether upon the dividends declared on these by the Central
Company. The Central never paid over 8 per cent, or a total of
$320,000 on 40,000 shares. The difference between this and $410,000,
or $90,000, constituted a direct loss which the Terminal pledged
itself to meet each year. If the victory of the friends of the
company in May is to be considered a genuine one, one wonders what
price the owners of the Georgia Company would have charged had the
election gone the other way.</p>

<p>With the Central of Georgia, the East Tennessee, and the Richmond
&amp; Danville under its control the Richmond Terminal could look for
still further extension. In 1890 it acquired control of the Erlanger
group of roads from Cincinnati in the north to Chattanooga, thence
to Meridian, Mississippi, thence to Vicksburg, Mississippi, and to
Shreveport, Louisiana. At the same time it took in the Louisville
Southern, which joined Louisville with the Cincinnati lines.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
In 1888 the Richmond &amp; Danville had concluded a close alliance with
the Atlantic Coast Line,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> and arrangements had been made for
terminal facilities at Norfolk.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> In 1889 it leased the Georgia
Pacific, and two years later, when this road reached Arkansas City,
it executed a traffic agreement with the Missouri Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a>
In 1891 the Georgia Pacific leased the Central Railroad &amp; Banking
Company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span> of Georgia for ninety-nine years at 7 per cent on its
capital stock.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> This immensely improved the connection of the
East Tennessee with the North and West, did away with the competition
of a parallel line, and afforded another outlet upon the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the Richmond Terminal system in 1890. Three great
north and south lines: one from Cincinnati through Birmingham to
York, over the Erlanger system; one from Bristol through Rome to
Selma, over the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia; and one from
Alexandria and West Point through Danville, Charlotte, and Atlanta to
Montgomery. One of these took business from Indiana, Illinois, and
the North and Central West; one from Baltimore, Philadelphia, and the
East; one from both West and East; and all three opened upon the Gulf
over the Mobile &amp; Birmingham to Mobile. In addition, three parallel
east and west lines: from Chattanooga to Memphis, from Birmingham to
Arkansas City, and from Meridian to Shreveport in Alabama; outlets
on the Atlantic coast at Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah, and
Brunswick; and dominance of the local traffic of the whole territory
east of Alabama, south of Kentucky and Tennessee, and north of
Florida. It was by all odds the leading system in the South. It had
a mileage of 8558.5 as compared with the 2383.4 of the Louisville &amp;
Nashville, and gross earnings, exclusive of the Erlanger lines, of
$41,361,095, or more than twice those of its greatest competitor.</p>

<p>And yet, for all its size, the Terminal group was perilously near
collapse. Its physical condition was poor and much of its mileage was
unprofitable; its capitalization was tainted with dishonesty; and
the legality of its recent combinations had not been tested in the
courts. Let us quote from the results of an examination made by a
well-known banking firm three years later.</p>

<p>“While in a general way the <em>main lines</em> of the Richmond &amp; Danville
[West Point and Alexandria to Atlanta],” said this firm in its
report, “are in fair condition—better than those of the East
Tennessee, excepting parts of its main line between Bristol and
Chattanooga, the Cincinnati, New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific, and the
Alabama Great Southern—nearly all the rail in both systems is too
light (50 to 60 lbs. while on the main lines it should be 70 to 75
lbs.), many of the trestles need renewing, and a large number of
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span> bridges, principally on the East Tennessee system, are not
sufficiently strong to warrant the use of heavy engines, which are
essential to hauling long trains and operating with economy. To a
very large extent ballast is altogether lacking or insufficient
in quantity. Excepting that portion of the equipment represented
by equipment bonds or notes, the engines and cars are generally
small and weak and unsuitable for main-line service, and are also
insufficient in quantity for any considerable enlargement of
business. Other appointments, such as shops, yards, etc., are, with
but few exceptions, crude and uneconomical.</p>

<p>“On the branches and secondary lines, especially those of the
Richmond &amp; Danville system, the condition is even worse, little or
no effort having been made to maintain them at proper standard,
even for a moderate traffic. About 700 miles of the Richmond &amp;
Danville secondary lines and branches (including about 200 miles of
narrow-gauge lines) are still laid with <em>iron rails</em>. On July 1st,
1892, there were 72 miles of iron rails in the <em>main</em> lines of the
East Tennessee.</p>

<p>“An expenditure of several million dollars should be promptly made on
these properties for equipment alone, but it is no use to do so, even
if it were possible, unless additional track and yard facilities are
also provided, nor unless such enlargements of engine and car shops
be made as will permit of the equipment being kept in order.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>This verdict was only reinforced by the characterization in detail of
a number of the subsidiary lines. Thus the Columbia &amp; Greenville was
termed “a collection of weak lines of constantly decreasing value”;
the Mobile &amp; Birmingham “of no value whatever to the East Tennessee”;
and the Memphis &amp; Charleston “valuable, but in a condition totally
unsuited to modern requirements.” How the capitalization of the
system was tainted with fraud has already been pointed out. The
legality of the recent combinations had not been tested in the
courts. In January, 1889, counsel for certain unnamed parties had
a plea for a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quo warranto</i> presented to the Attorney-General of
Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> The petition alleged that the purchase of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span> control
of the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railway and of the Virginia
Midland was an abuse of the powers of the Richmond &amp; West Point
Terminal ... a violation of public policy, and an usurpation to the
great damage and prejudice of the constitution and laws of Virginia.
This petition the Attorney-General dismissed on technical grounds.
The legality of the various mergers was soon, however, to be attacked
again, and in 1889 the question was decidedly unsettled.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>The storm broke in August, 1891. On the eighth of that month the New
York <cite>Herald</cite> published a vigorous onslaught upon the company. It
maintained that the Richmond &amp; Danville system had failed to earn its
fixed charges by $526,560 in the year ending 1890; that this fact had
been concealed by deceptive or false entries on the books which made
a fictitious profit emerge by covering up the losses on auxiliary
lines; that the 8 per cent dividends which had been paid on the
Central of Georgia had not of late years been earned, and that the
price paid for the Georgia Central stock had been grossly excessive;
that the East Tennessee was just about paying its way; and, finally,
that the other recent acquisitions were either just paying their way
or were showing annual deficits.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> Color was given to the charges
by the trouble caused by the floating debt. Though denied by the
officials of the company, the sale of 2000 shares of Baltimore &amp; Ohio
stock held in the Terminal treasury;<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> the negotiation of a short
time loan at 6 per cent and 2½ per cent commission for the Central
of Georgia and the extension of another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span> loan;<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> the placing of
$500,000 at 6 per cent for the Richmond &amp; Danville; and the active
financial support which General Thomas felt obliged to render the
East Tennessee showed the anxiety which it occasioned.</p>

<p>On November 25 the directors held a meeting and appointed Messrs.
Eckstein Norton, late president of the Louisville &amp; Nashville; Wm.
Solomon, of Speyer &amp; Co.; Jacob H. Schiff, of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.; Chas.
S. Fairchild, president of the New York Security &amp; Trust Company;
and Louis Fitzgerald, president of the Mercantile Trust Company, a
committee to carefully inquire into and examine the condition of the
Terminal properties and to aid the company in perfecting a plan of
readjustment. Owing to the financial depression, they explained, “the
company has been unable to sell securities based upon engagements
they had made prior to the period of depression and to pay for
necessary equipment and improvements. A large floating debt has in
this way been accumulated, but each of our important railroad systems
is solvent.... After maturely considering the whole situation, we
felt it wise to invite the gentlemen whose names appear ... to aid
us in perfecting the best plan for a permanent adjustment of our
affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>The committee reported provisionally on December 8. It then stated
that it was essential to the proposed plan of relief that the
elections of all the subordinate companies in the Richmond Terminal
system should be postponed till after the Richmond Terminal affairs
were settled, and requested that financial provision be made for
the employment of an expert or experts in the examination of the
properties and accounts. It was understood that the committee’s
plan was to make a considerable assessment on the stockholders. The
board of directors refused to respond and the committee therefore
withdrew.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
The next day the stockholders selected Mr. F. P. Olcott to appoint
a new committee to take up the work.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> They were not in favor
of radical action, and Mr. Olcott expressed the opinion that there
was no necessity for measures so stringent as those which the
Schiff-Norton Committee had had in mind. It was but natural that at
this point there should have been some delay. Meetings were held,
expedients for raising cash discussed, and a reorganization plan was
gradually whipped into shape. It was not, therefore, until March 19,
1892, that the public were informed what Mr. Olcott and his backers
did consider that the situation required. The main points of the
elaborate scheme which was then proposed were as follows:</p>

<p>First, a consolidation of the Richmond Terminal, Richmond &amp; Danville,
and East Tennessee properties. The Central of Georgia and the
Erlanger systems were not to be included in the reorganization, but
the interest of the Richmond Terminal and the East Tennessee in their
stock was to be made subject to a new mortgage.</p>

<p>Second, a reduction in fixed charges.</p>

<p>Third, the sale of securities to pay off the floating debt.</p>

<p>Consolidation of properties was found advisable for several reasons.
“While some of the companies show a surplus of earnings,” said the
committee, “in many instances it has been impossible to apply such
surplus earnings to make up deficiencies arising from the operations
of other companies. The committee finds that the various systems
have not been operated throughout for the common benefit of the
controlling interest, but that they have competed among themselves
for business, each system maintaining separate organizations for
obtaining business.... In the judgment of the committee the only
adequate remedy which can be adopted is to unite the several
corporations, as far as practicable, in one system under one
management, and to consolidate their obligations.”</p>

<p>In order to unify the system the committee proposed three great
issues of new securities as follows:</p>

<p>$170,000,000 four per cent first mortgage 35-year gold bonds, to be
issued by a new corporation representing the consolidation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad Company and the Richmond &amp; West Point
Terminal Railway &amp; Warehouse Company.</p>

<p>$70,000,000 five per cent non-cumulative preferred stock.</p>

<p>$110,000,000 common stock.</p>

<p>In general, the new bonds were to exchange for old bonds and the new
common stock for old common and preferred, while the new preferred
stock was to be joined in varying proportions with each of the
other issues to make the exchanges look attractive. Thus, for the
Richmond &amp; Danville consolidated 6s were offered 120 per cent in
new bonds and 45 per cent in new preferred; for the East Tennessee
first mortgage 7s 120 per cent in new bonds and 45 per cent in new
preferred stock; for the Richmond Terminal common stock 100 per cent
in new common and 50 per cent in new preferred. This arrangement was
not rigidly adhered to. Some of the poorer of the outstanding stocks
received new common only, and the Richmond Terminal preferred was
given par in new bonds besides a bonus in preferred. These were,
however, exceptions. The principle which determined the various
ratios of exchange is more difficult to discover. It was not that
of equivalence of return. The plan did not attempt to allow to
each holder a chance at the same receipts which he had formerly
enjoyed while reducing the amount which he could demand, but gave
sometimes more than this and sometimes less. And the variations from
what might be called a normal ratio did not always correspond with
the relative security of different issues as indicated by their
market quotations. For instance, the East Tennessee first 7s sold
in December, 1891, at 113½ and the Richmond Terminal collateral 6s
at 83; yet the former received 120 per cent and 35 per cent and
the latter 120 per cent and 40 per cent in new bonds and preferred
stock respectively. Again, the Atlanta &amp; Charlotte first 7s sold in
October, 1891, at 118½ and received under the plan 120 per cent in
bonds and 40 per cent in preferred stock; the Richmond &amp; Danville
consolidated 6s sold at 109 and received 120 per cent and 45 per
cent. It is clear that the committee desired to reduce the interest
which the various classes of bonds should have a right to demand, and
that it expected to make compensation by means of preferred stock
on which payments should be made if earned. So much of its scheme
was commendable. On the other hand, the rates of exchange of old
securities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span> for new were in many cases ill-advised. The reduction
in fixed charges was to be $1,819,837, although by the exchanges
alone the capitalization was to be increased by over $50,000,000.
The charges on the system had amounted in 1891 to $9,474,837.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>
Net earnings had been $8,744,736. Fixed charges under the plan were
to amount to $7,666,000. As a matter of fact they would have been
greater than this, for some of the old bonds would have remained
outstanding, and the estimate did not include interest on any bonds
issued for improvements. The floating debt was to be retired by
the sale of new securities, namely, $18,235,800 new first mortgage
bonds and $6,382,530 preferred stock. These were to net $14,588,640,
or sufficient to cancel a debt of $6,310,000 and car trusts of
$2,369,564 and to provide a balance for miscellaneous uses. A
syndicate guaranteed the sale, but holders of stock or of collateral
trust 5 per cent bonds were to be allowed to subscribe up to 16 per
cent of their holdings at the rate of $800 for one new mortgage bond
and $350 in new stock. New bonds to a maximum of $10,000,000 were
to be issued only for the acquisition of additional property, while
beyond this the vote of a majority of preferred stock was to be
required to authorize any additional mortgage on property covered by
the first mortgage.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></p>

<p>Such was the plan laid before securityholders. It proposed a
considerable reduction in fixed charges, though probably not
enough to put the company out of danger, and a large increase
in new securities. It failed because it imposed losses upon the
wrong parties. As between the various classes of bonds its terms
were frequently inequitable. As between the bonds and the stock
it altogether favored the latter. It levied no assessment, it
compelled no subscription to new securities, and in three cases only
did it announce an intention of reducing the nominal value of the
stockholders’ holdings.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> The original time limit for deposits was
set at April 14,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span> 1892. This was subsequently extended, but without
effect, and on May 16 the Olcott Committee announced that the plan
had failed.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p>The collapse of this attempt at readjustment was a blow to those who
had hoped for a speedy and amicable reorganization of the Richmond
Terminal system. On the same day that failure was confessed the
stockholders met and appointed Messrs. W. E. Strong, Samuel Thomas,
and W. P. Clyde a committee to confer with the Olcott Committee
to ascertain what had best be done. A week later General Thomas
reported a plan for the reorganization of the Richmond &amp; Danville
alone. The Richmond Terminal Company, he said, should be wound up and
be succeeded by a new company with $43,000,000 of preferred stock
and $70,000,000 of common. The present 6 per cent bonds should be
given 170 in new preferred stock; the present 5 per cent bonds and
preferred stock par in new preferred stock; and the present common
should receive par in new common and be compelled to subscribe for
$8,000,000 collateral trust two-year 6 per cent notes at 92½.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a>
This amounted to an assessment of 10 per cent upon the common. It was
not proposed to pay off the floating debt with the proceeds of this
assessment, but to buy the claims held by bankers, and, if necessary,
foreclose these claims and take possession for the stockholders. If
the full amount should not be subscribed by the stockholders the
preferred stock was to have the right to make subscription for the
balance, and to take the securities that would have gone to the
non-paying common stock; and the common stock not subscribing was to
have no rights to the common stock of the new company.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>That this scheme was much more radical as well as more limited than
the Olcott plan appears upon its face. No serious attempt was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
made to carry it into effect. On suggestion of General Thomas the
stockholders’ meeting voted that a consulting committee of fifteen
be appointed by the chair to confer with the committee of three, and
then adjourned subject to call.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> The enlarged committee found
that application had been already made to Messrs. Drexel, Morgan &amp;
Co. by a number of prominent banking firms, asking that they enter
upon the work of reorganization. It therefore dropped the Thomas plan
and joined in the petition. Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. on their part agreed
to undertake an examination of the Terminal property,<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> but four
weeks later replied that while in their opinion a reorganization was
feasible, the lack of assurance of support from Mr. Clyde made them
unwilling to undertake the task.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p>At this point efforts at reorganization were checked. One plan had
failed, one had been formulated but not pushed forward, and the task
of creating a third had been refused by the banking firm which was
apparently best able to carry a plan to a successful conclusion. For
a time now the field was left to the disputes between members of the
Richmond Terminal family, which made up in bitterness for what they
lacked in the matter of valuable result. Mention will be made only of
the wrangles between the Central of Georgia and the other parts of
the system.</p>

<p>The Central of Georgia had been placed under a receiver of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
own some two weeks before the publication of the Olcott plan. Some
months later this receivership was made permanent, and the Richmond
Terminal was enjoined from voting the 42,200 shares of Central stock
which it held. It can scarcely be said that the withdrawal of the
Central of Georgia from the Terminal system was unwelcome to the
latter. Already the Richmond &amp; Danville had refused to carry out its
guarantee on the Central’s stock unless that company should deposit
bonds to cover an alleged sum due from it,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> and President Oakman
had hastened to inform General Alexander, the temporary Central
receiver, that the Richmond &amp; Danville would not operate the Central
of Georgia after the end of the temporary receivership.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> When,
however, the Central not only insisted on withdrawal, but asked
Judge Speer, of the District Court of Macon, Georgia, to appoint a
receiver for the Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad on the ground that that
company was insolvent and was indebted to the Central in the sum of
$2,459,670,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> prompt action was made necessary. Application was
made to Judge Bond of the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia, and on June 16 this magistrate appointed Messrs. F. W.
Huidekoper and Reuben Foster receivers of the Danville road.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p>“This appointment of receivers by Judge Bond,” explained the parties
responsible,<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> “is not only not inimical to nor in opposition to
any plan for the financial reorganization and rehabilitation of the
Danville system, but will be found to greatly facilitate and aid
any plan of reorganization, while if the Georgia court had obtained
possession of and jurisdiction over the Danville system this would
have been rendered practically impossible.... The necessity for such
action,” they continued, with a touch of pathos, “will be further
appreciated when it is known that for some weeks past the Richmond &amp;
Danville Company has not been able to keep either a dollar in bank or
in its safes within the state of Georgia, because every such dollar
has been attached or garnished by parties alleging claims<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span> against
the company, and even the money sent by express for the liquidation
of pay-rolls has been attached in the hands of the express company,
and in every instance enormous bonds have been required to release
such moneys....”<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></p>

<p>The temporary securing of their position by the receivership allowed
the Danville people to hit back at the Central in its weakest
point—the details of the sale to the Terminal of the Georgia
Central Company. On August 19 the Advisory Committee of Seventeen
of the Terminal securityholders declared that the investigations of
their sub-committee showed that certain trustees of the company,
with their friends, had profited to the extent of between three and
four million dollars in this operation.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> Toward the end of the
year tender of the Georgia Company stock and bonds was made back
to the original vendors and was refused.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> In December suit was
begun to set aside the purchase on the ground that there had been
no ratification sufficient in law or equity to bar the stockholders
from cancelling the transaction. The plaintiff charged that “the
said combination and plan so formed by and between its president and
divers of its directors [referring to the purchase of the Georgia
stock], confederating with the other syndicate defendants for the
purpose of selling their unsalable and discredited securities to
the plaintiff at such prices as yielded them an enormous profit and
necessarily imposed on plaintiff a heavy yearly loss, was contrary
to equity and good conscience, and that the pretended contract dated
October 26, 1888, ... and all the acts done in pretended purchase of
the stocks and bonds of said Georgia Company ... and the taking from
the assets and money of the plaintiff of over $7,000,000 cash ... to
put into the pockets of the said faithless directors, the syndicate
defendants, and their confederates, were all acts planned ... and
performed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span> by said Inman, or under his direction, in the execution
of such original fraudulent scheme, combination, purpose, and
confederacy....” And so the plaintiff prayed the court to decree the
contract of purchase void.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>These accusations and counter-accusations, justified though many
of them were, had little direct bearing on reorganization. In this
progress had completely ceased. At the same time some progress was
urgently required. The Richmond Terminal, the Richmond &amp; Danville,
and the Central of Georgia were in the hands each of a different set
of receivers, unpaid interest was piling up, and the year 1893 was
to show a marked decline in earnings. Necessity and mutual distrust
dictated a second appeal to Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. to undertake the
rehabilitation of the property. On February 2, 1893, the following
letter was addressed to the firm in question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">Messrs. Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.,</p>

<p>Gentlemen: Since the time you were previously requested to take
up the reorganization of the Richmond Terminal system much time
and thought have been devoted to its affairs, and we realize that
adverse financial conditions and also the present general distrust
of all plans for the restoration of this system require that, to
be successful, its reorganization must be undertaken by parties
possessing the confidence of both the securityholders and the public,
and also the financial strength sufficient for its accomplishment.
We therefore ask you to take up this reorganization of the Richmond
Terminal and its allied properties, each pledging you our personal
support and aid in full confidence that the securityholders will
support us in this request.</p>

<p>We appreciate the labor and responsibility connected with this
undertaking, and are therefore willing to do all in our power to give
you full control of the reorganization, as suggested in your letter
of June 28,<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> and to advise our friends and the securityholders
generally to deposit their securities, without requiring the
assurances customary in such cases.</p>

<div class="sig-container"><div class="sig">
<p class="in0">Very respectfully,<br />
<span class="in8"><span class="smcap">Wm. P. Clyde</span>,</span><br />
<span class="in8"><span class="smcap">Geo. F. Stone</span>,</span><br />
<span class="in8"><span class="smcap">Wm. E. Strong</span>,</span><br />
<span class="in8"><span class="smcap">J. C. Maben</span>,</span><br />
<span class="in8"><span class="smcap">Thomas F. Ryan</span>.</span>
</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
This letter was accompanied by a letter from F. P. Olcott, president
of the Central Trust Company, pledging his support. Inasmuch as
lack of the assurances contained in this correspondence had alone
prevented Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. from undertaking the task proposed
the previous year, their prompt though conditional acceptance was
not surprising. A definitive engagement to attempt the work followed
on April 12.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> The enlistment of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. in the
reorganization provoked general satisfaction. Mr. Hollins, of the
Central of Georgia reorganization committee, expressed his pleasure
in having responsible parties to deal with not connected with any
past differences.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> The directors of the Richmond Terminal urged
all classes of securityholders to deposit, and the Clyde Committee
was emphatic in its recommendation. It was recognized that the
situation was the most favorable which could be hoped for. No group
of Southern railroad financiers seemed capable of producing a fair
reorganization plan, and it was also probable that no plan from such
a source, however fair, would have received a sympathetic welcome.
Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., on the other hand, were both capable and sure
of a hearing.</p>

<p>There was remarkably little delay in making public the Drexel-Morgan
plan. Less than three weeks after their final acceptance of
responsibility, though about three months after the correspondence
of February 2, the firm published a comprehensive plan, to the
examination of which the next few pages may be devoted. The
principles of this plan of May 1, 1893, were simple, and were clearly
and convincingly set forth. The property to be considered was to be
that of the Richmond Terminal, the Richmond &amp; Danville, and the East
Tennessee. The Central of Georgia was to be omitted. The imperative
needs of these properties the plan declared to be two:</p>

<p>First, the provision of a large sum for the physical improvement of
the system;</p>

<p>Second, the reduction of fixed charges to an amount which the
companies could earn.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
The physical condition of the above roads in 1893 was extremely bad.
“One obvious trouble ... is,” said the plan, “that their maintenance
and repairs have been neglected. Another is that, while nearly all
the lines in the United States have been steadily substituting solid
roadbeds, heavy equipment, and other modern facilities for the light
and ineffective appliances formerly in use, these lines, because of
the constant drain to which they were subject for the obligations
assumed, and from the necessities of the Terminal Company for the
payment to it, as dividends, of every available dollar with which to
meet its own obligations, have not been in a financial condition to
keep up to the times in this respect, and now they find themselves
so far behind as to be, to a considerable extent, unqualified to
handle business with economy, or to compete successfully with other
lines.”<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> The financial condition was little better. The absolute
fixed charges of the Richmond Terminal, the Richmond &amp; Danville,
and the East Tennessee systems, viz., interest on bonds held by the
public, rentals, equipment notes, and sinking funds, and interest
on floating debts, receivers’ certificates, etc., the plan declared
to amount annually to about $9,900,000. The entire net earnings for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, were estimated at $7,000,000.
The result was a deficit for the year of about $2,900,000. This
state of affairs required serious sacrifices from somebody. The
Olcott plan had illustrated the folly of laying the burden largely
on well-secured senior bonds. The Drexel plan proposed to demand
the necessary concessions from the junior bonds and from the stock.
“About $74,000,000 of the bonds and guaranteed stocks of the Richmond
&amp; Danville and the East Tennessee systems held by the public,” it
continued, “are on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span> properties which are believed for the most part
to afford adequate security, and for this or other reasons this plan
has not sought to disturb them. About $50,000,000 (mostly recent
issues) are junior liens, inadequately secured, or else are on new
or branch lines of uncertain earning capacity, and the holders, in
self-preservation, must make such reasonable concessions as the
situation necessitates, taking compensation therefor in preferred or
common stock of the new company....”</p>

<p>The tools of the reorganization were to be the following new issues:</p>

<p>$140,000,000 first consolidated mortgage and collateral trust
100-year 5 per cent bonds, secured by mortgage and pledge of all
the property of the new company. This total might be subsequently
increased to acquire the whole or part of the Georgia Central system,
or to acquire the ownership of the Cincinnati Southern Railway or any
other line as a substitute therefor.</p>

<p>$75,000,000 5 per cent non-cumulative preferred stock.</p>

<p>$160,000,000 common stock.</p>

<p>“The general theory of adjustment of disturbed bonds,” said the
plan, “is to substitute for them the new 5 per cent bonds to such an
extent as is warranted by earnings and situation of the properties
covered by the present mortgages, and the new preferred stock for
the remainder of the principal. In some cases, where the bonds are
on properties of no actual and little prospective earning capacity,
a more severe reduction is necessary. In several instances, where
the bonds are on properties which are likely to improve more rapidly
than other disturbed parts of the system, this fact is recognized,
and an extra allowance is made in compensation. Finally, in one or
two cases, where the bonds are on properties the loss of which would
adversely affect the rest of the system, a proper recognition is made
of this fact.” In practice not only bonds and preferred stock, but
preferred and common stock, or even common stock alone were exchanged
for old securities of little value.</p>

<p>This provided for old securities but not for cash requirements.
To raise cash three devices were resorted to, all of which bore
entirely on the junior securityholders or on the stock. The most
direct was the levying of an assessment. Terminal common stock was
assessed $12.50 per share, East Tennessee first preferred $3,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
second preferred $6, and common stock $9; new preferred stock being
in each case given in return. This distribution was based on the
idea that the stockholders of each railroad should provide for its
floating debt. The floating debt of the Richmond &amp; Danville was
about $7,000,000, that of the East Tennessee about $3,000,000, and
that of the Richmond Terminal about $100,000. But since the last
named held practically all of the Richmond stock and a considerable
proportion of the East Tennessee, its stockholders were saddled with
a total of $8,300,000 or an equivalent of $12.50 per share, while
the East Tennessee was taxed proportionately. The rest of the cash
requirements were covered by the sale of $8,000,000 new bonds at 85,
and $33,333,000 new common stock at 15. Depositors of all classes of
Terminal securities and of all classes of readjusted securities of
the other systems were allowed to subscribe to the extent of $1000 in
a new bond and $4000 in new stock trust certificates for each $22,000
par value of stocks or bonds deposited. The balance of the issues was
looked after by an underwriting syndicate.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p>Future capital requirements were provided for mainly by new bonds.
$35,383,000 in new 5 per cents were set aside to be used only for new
construction, betterments, purchase of rolling stock, and extensions
and additions to the system. Not over $2,500,000 of these were
to be used in any one calendar year; except that, in addition to
this annual appropriation, a total of $3,000,000 in bonds might be
specifically appropriated with the unanimous consent of the stock
trustees, for the building of branches or extensions, if undertaken
within three years after the creation of the new mortgage. All
property acquired with these bonds was to be brought under the lien
of the new mortgage. $8,000,000 of the cash raised by assessment
and sale of securities, moreover, were to be available<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span> for new
construction and equipment on the Richmond &amp; Danville and the East
Tennessee. And, finally, there was provision for the limitation of
new bond issues, for a voting trust and for the consolidation of the
Terminal system.</p>

<p>“The ultimate object of the reorganization,” said the plan
“(excluding the Georgia Central Company from consideration), is to
have the new company acquire, so far as practicable, the ownership
of the Richmond &amp; Danville and East Tennessee systems, including the
various securities now owned by the Terminal Company ... and the
securities pledged for the Richmond &amp; Danville and East Tennessee
floating debt....</p>

<p>“Both classes of stock of the new company ... are to be issued to
three Stock Trustees, who shall be appointed, on or before completion
of reorganization, by Messrs. Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. The stock shall be
held by the Stock Trustees and their successors, jointly, for five
years, and for such further period (if any) as shall elapse before
the preferred stock shall have paid 5 per cent cash dividend in one
year, although the Stock Trustees may, in their discretion, deliver
the stock at an earlier date....</p>

<p>“No additional mortgage shall be put upon the property to be acquired
hereunder by the new company, nor shall the authorized amount of the
preferred stock be increased without the consent in each case of the
majority in amount of the preferred stockholders.”<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>The result of all these provisions was to be a cancellation of
the floating debt, a reduction in fixed charges, and a decrease
in mortgage bonds; though inevitably also an increase in stock
outstanding. The plan proposed to disturb $49,117,900 of outstanding
bonds, or, including the Richmond Terminal 5s and 6s, a total of
$65,617,900. But the new bonds which it offered in exchange amounted
to $19,806,700 only. On the other hand it took $111,819,550 in stock
from the hands of the public, and offered $165,559,514 new stock in
the course of the exchanges.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> This was very conservative, since
the increase in total capitalization through these exchanges was less
than 4½ per cent; and less too than the cash assessment for which
preferred stock was allowed. Somewhat greater increase in securities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
appears if we consider, not only the exchanges, but the provisions
of the plan as a whole; for here we must include $33,300,000 new
common stock and $8,000,000 new bonds issued to retire in part the
$12,900,000 of floating debt and for other purposes. Even so the
net increase was only 6 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> The natural result was a
considerable reduction in fixed charges. The absolute fixed charges
of the system in 1893 the plan stated to be $9,900,000. The fixed
charges under the plan were to be $6,789,000. This was certainly
a step in the right direction. It was the point, nevertheless, at
which the plan was weakest. The clauses which have been outlined
made abundant and conservative provision for cash requirements;
and the sums which they allowed for future development were not on
their face inadequate; but the reduction in fixed charges was less
than should have been ensured. The net earnings for the year ending
June 30, 1892, were $7,725,000, and those for 1893 were estimated by
the plan itself as not likely to exceed $7,000,000. This would have
left $936,000 over the proposed fixed charges in 1892 and $211,000
in 1893:—or a surplus of some 3 per cent in the latter year. This
was altogether insufficient. It not only put out of the question
dividends on the $200,000,000 of stock, but it precluded the partial
improvement of the road from earnings, and left the system at the
mercy of the slightest decrease in the annual returns. Compared with
previous fixed charges the plan proposed noteworthy reductions;
compared with the earnings of the lines involved it did not go far
enough.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>The reception of the Drexel-Morgan plan was, nevertheless,
satisfactory. Certain concessions were made to various classes of
bonds, and by June 17, over 95 per cent of the securityholders had
given their assent.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> Unfortunately the earnings of the property
now steadily decreased. The gross receipts of the Richmond &amp; Danville
proper were 15 per cent less in 1893 than in 1892; and Terminal
system lines which had earned $6,100,000 in 1892 earned $5,300,000
in 1893, and promised to earn some $4,250,000 only in 1894. This
decrease was common to the country at large. It was of peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
importance, however, in emphasizing the weak point in the Drexel
plan. From January 1 to July 1, 1893, the Terminal floating debt,
exclusive of car trusts, increased $2,600,000. From July 1 to March
1 it increased at least a million more. The reorganization plan had
been prepared “on the assumption that, during reorganization, the
receivers of the various properties could provide for the interest
charges on the undisturbed securities, as well as accumulate a sum
sufficient for the interest accruing on the ‘disturbed securities’
as readjusted.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> As it turned out, the receivers were obliged
to make many defaults among the undisturbed securities, and saved
nothing for the disturbed. Some modification of the published plan
had perforce to be arranged.</p>

<p>These modifications were detailed in a pamphlet dated February 20,
1894. They comprised three proposals:</p>

<p>(1) To exclude from the reorganization certain unprofitable
properties which had previously been included. Certain alterations
had already been made toward this end in the exclusion of the
Erlanger line, the Memphis &amp; Charleston, and the Mobile &amp; Birmingham.
Further modification was to exclude the Northeastern Railroad of
Georgia, the Macon &amp; Northern, and five other subsidiary lines.</p>

<p>(2) To fund for a year or two the coupons on new bonds given for
certain securities, and to provide in other cases that the new bonds
should not bear interest till 1895 or 1896.</p>

<p>(3) To lighten the assessment on Richmond Terminal and East Tennessee
common stock, and to allow to all assessed securities one-quarter
of their assessment in bonds and three-quarters in preferred stock
instead of all in preferred stock.</p>

<p>At the same time a few other modifications allowed to some bonds a
more liberal grant of new securities than they had obtained in May.
It was hoped by these means to raise the average earning ability of
the system, while reducing the new securities to be issued.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
The temporary funding of coupons further lightened fixed charges
until business should have had time to revive. “Under the plan as now
modified,” stated Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., “and assuming that one-half
of the new bonds to be sold are used in 1894 and the other half in
1895, the fixed charges are estimated at about</p>

<p>“The depression in the South began in 1890–91. There would appear
to be no reason why in a comparatively short time these properties
should not very easily earn, <em>gross</em>, as much as and more than they
earned in that fiscal year, viz., over $21,000,000. Operated at
70 per cent ... there would remain, say $6,600,000 net against an
interest charge of $5,400,000.”<a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p>The reduction in assessments was made possible by the decrease in
mileage. Although the floating debt had increased $2,600,000 from
January 1, 1893, and the equipment notes recorded were greater by
$1,048,000,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> yet the debt to be provided for by the modified plan
of 1894 was estimated at only $12,200,000. Besides this the cash to
be reserved for new construction was reduced $3,000,000, and the
surplus for expenses and contingencies $1,380,000. Assessments were
therefore set at $10 a share on Richmond Terminal common instead of
$12.50; $7.20 on East Tennessee common instead of $9; and $3 and
$6 on East Tennessee first and second preferred as before. The new
securities to be sold were reduced correspondingly to $8,000,000 of
bonds and $25,000,000 of common stock. Finally, the bonds to provide
for new construction, betterments, and additions were reduced from
$35,383,000 to about $19,000,000, of which not over $2,000,000
(instead of $2,500,000) were to be used in any calendar year. Other
provisions of the earlier plan were to remain unchanged.</p>

<p>It was this modified plan which was carried to a successful
conclusion. In principle it did not mend the weak spot in its
predecessor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span> of May. That plan had contemplated a surplus of $211,000
over fixed charges for 1893. This estimated charges at $4,100,000
for 1894 and net earnings at $4,250,000 on a somewhat reduced
mileage. There was not to be more left for dividends and improvements
than there had been before, while the cash and bond provisions
for improvements were notably reduced. The concession of bonds
to stockholders for one-quarter of their assessments was unsound
financiering, as was, on the whole, the funding of coupons on the new
mortgage bonds. The success which the modification had, nevertheless,
in restoring the company to solvency, was due to the improvement
in earnings which soon took place. The original plan had based its
calculations on the first year of depression; the amended plan kept
charges down till three years had elapsed. By that time business had
begun to mend, and all danger of bankruptcy was past. Other points in
either plan leave little to criticise.</p>

<p>The modifications to the original plan were issued on February
20, 1894. Over 75 per cent of the system bonds had assented by
March 24. At one foreclosure sale after another the reorganization
committee now bought in the portions of the old system covered by
the plan. Suits against the Richmond Terminal had been brought
under the two collateral mortgages, and on July 13, 1893, the
reorganization committee bid in the pledged securities. On February
6, 1894, it bought the remaining assets of the Terminal Company;
on June 15 it bought the Richmond &amp; Danville, and on July 7 the
East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia. Two trustees’ sales, one
receivers’ sale, ten foreclosure sales, and six conveyances without
foreclosure had occurred by September, 1894, and more minor sales
were in progress.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> On June 15 the Southern Railway Company was
organized with a charter from the state of Virginia, and took over
in succession properties to the extent of 4607 miles.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> Samuel
Spencer was elected president. Some thirty corporations were swept
away and thirty boards of directors abolished; for the Southern
Railway was an operating company, and, unlike the Richmond Terminal
and the Richmond &amp; Danville, controlled but an inappreciable fraction
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span> its mileage through the ownership of stock. The new securities
were issued at the proper times, and according to the plan the common
and preferred stock was turned over to three voting trustees,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>
who issued trust certificates in their stead.</p>

<p>This completed the reorganization of the Richmond Terminal Company so
far as the principal part of its mileage was concerned. The portions
of the system excluded from the plan have been to some extent bought
back in later years. Control of the Alabama Great Southern was bought
in 1895; the Memphis &amp; Charleston was acquired in 1898; the Richmond
&amp; Mecklenburg was leased in 1898 and the Mobile &amp; Birmingham in
1899; and the Northeastern of Georgia was bought in 1899. The system
has not yet, however, fully regained its old position. The most
important loss has undoubtedly been that of the Central of Georgia.
We left this company engaged in active disputes with the Terminal
management. During 1892 and 1893 efforts to reorganize it were made
under the leadership of Hollins &amp; Co. The principal difficulties were
the large floating debt and the money required to put the property
into good physical condition.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> A plan was actually prepared at
the beginning of 1893 and submitted to securityholders, but failed
because of that same decline in earnings which had caused the
modification of the Terminal reorganization plan. A second plan,
prepared in 1894, had a better fate,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> and in modified form was
put into effect. The <em>Railroad</em> was sold at auction in 1895, the
Central of Georgia <em>Railway</em> was organized to take its place,<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a>
and the corporation entered upon a new career which we have not space
to follow.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>As for the Southern Railway, the years from 1895 to 1907 have
brought it prosperity. It has extended considerably in mileage.
Besides reacquiring lines which formerly were part of the Richmond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Terminal system, it has grown south to Jacksonville and Palatka,
east to Charleston and to a more direct connection with Norfolk,
and west from Louisville to East St. Louis. It has further joined
its Louisville-East St. Louis line to Chicago by acquiring a
half-interest in the Monon, and to the rest of its system by a
half-interest in the Cincinnati, New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific; and
it has bought control of the Mobile &amp; Ohio, which stretches through
four states from East St. Louis to Mobile. Instead of 4392 miles as
operated on June 30, 1895, it now reports 7546. The earnings of the
system have increased more rapidly than its mileage. The revival of
business after 1897 occurred with singular force in the South, and
seems to have introduced there a new industrial era. As a result, the
Southern’s gross earnings have trebled and its net earnings have been
multiplied by two. Passenger receipts, which were $4,329,499 in 1895,
have become $14,683,006 in 1907. Freight receipts have increased from
$10,816,024 to $37,368,095.</p>

<p>It has been this increase in earnings which has at last allowed some
of that margin for improvements which the reorganization plans weakly
attempted to secure. And accordingly, large sums have been expended.
Maintenance of way charges are now over $1000 per mile instead of
$630. Expenses per locomotive mile have increased from 4.19 cents in
1895 to 7.54 cents in 1907; expenses per passenger car mile from .83
to 1.03 cents; and expenses per freight car mile from .47 to 2.18
cents. It is true that locomotives and cars are larger to-day and
that rails are heavier, but this fact is far from accounting for the
difference. Not only has the existing plant been kept in good repair
from earnings alone, but distinct improvements have been made. New
rail has been laid, additional ballast put in, wooden trestles filled
or replaced with steel. It was estimated in 1906 that $5,000,000 had
been spent in betterments and charged against income up to that time,
besides some $15,000,000 more paid for equipment out of earnings.
Meanwhile considerable sums had been spent from capital account. The
reorganization plan allowed for some $19,000,000 of new bonds to be
sold at the rate of $2,000,000 per year.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> Of these the company
had sold $13,000,000 for improvement of the property by February 1,
1906, besides disposing of some $23,000,000 of equipment obligations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
The appreciation of the need for still more liberal expenditure led
in 1906 to a comprehensive plan for the issue of new capital. Under
date of February 1, the company submitted to its voting trustees<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>
a scheme for a $200,000,000 mortgage, of which $15,000,000 were to
be issued at once and the rest were to be reserved. Of the immediate
issue $4,962,774 were to refund payments for equipment hitherto made
and charged to capital; $3,501,000 were to refund investments in
securities of, and advances to, subordinate companies, as well as
to be used for the acquisition of property not heretofore funded;
and $6,536,226 were for double track, revision of grades, new
yards, shops, etc. Of the securities reserved, $65,164,000 were
for refunding purposes: $20,000,000 for certain subsidiary lines:
and $99,834,000 to go, first, for betterments and improvements on
the entire system and for new equipment in amounts not exceeding
$5,000,000 in each year; and second, in exchange for first mortgage
bonds not exceeding in amount the actual cost of railroads and
terminals hereafter to be acquired. In other words, about one-half of
the total issue is to go, sooner or later, for improvements, and the
rest for refundings and for new acquisitions.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> It was believed
that the Southern could readily pay the interest on the increased
immediate issue without endangering dividends on its preferred stock,
and that the subsequent increases in earnings would more than provide
for whatever additions to charges might occur. Negotiations for the
placing of the new securities were concluded with J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.
at a reported price of 96½.</p>

<p>The results of the expenditures for improvements have been
remarkable. In 1895 the Southern Railway had in use 623 locomotives;
in 1907 the number was 1536. In the former year there were 487
passenger cars and 18,924 freight cars; in the latter there were
respectively 995 and 56,225.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> Only 370 miles of track in 1895
were over 65 pounds in weight per yard; more than 3100<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span> surpassed
that limit in 1907. It is nevertheless in its inability to handle
the business offered it that the Southern has provoked sharpest
criticism. Over 3600 miles of its system still have rails weighing
62 pounds or less to the yard;—that is, rails incapable of meeting
modern operating conditions. Only 206 miles of double and 1981
of side track exist. Equipment appears to be still inadequate.
Signals are imperfect, and speed and promptness seemingly impossible
to attain. The late tragic death of Mr. Spencer was a forcible
illustration of the deficiencies of the road which he had done so
much to improve.</p>

<p>The earning power of the system cannot yet, therefore, be said
to be secure. Moreover, the capitalization of almost $72,000 per
mile,<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> as well as the less dense railroad business in the South,
the slight construction of many of the Southern Railway lines, the
lack of adequate facilities which compels an operating ratio of 76
per cent, and the absorption of minor roads less prosperous than the
main stem,—all these factors have kept down the net surplus from
operation. On the other hand, the management is making an earnest
attempt to raise the standard of the property. Bonds and notes to the
par value of over $32,000,000 have been sold to provide for additions
and improvements during the past year, and a very great change for
the better has taken place. Dividends on the preferred stock have
been paid since 1897. As the country develops, and as the sums
spent upon improvements come more and more to have their effects, a
dividend upon the common stock will be paid. The near future is more
likely to witness the cessation of dividends upon the preferred.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad has been reorganized twice,
in 1889 and in 1893–5; the first time without, but the second time
after a foreclosure sale. The keynote of its history has been
extension. It was the enterprise of the men in control before 1889
which gave it the position and power it holds to-day, but it was
also that enterprise which necessitated its first reorganization by
imposing upon it heavier burdens than it could bear.</p>

<p>Chartered in Kansas in 1863, the Atchison spread west, southwest,
south, and northeast. It received some aid from the state of Kansas
in the shape of a grant of lands, but depended primarily on the
investment of private capital. Kansas itself was not, in 1870, a very
encouraging field for railroad building. It had been admitted as a
state only in 1861, and could boast for the most part of less than
two inhabitants to the square mile;—although settlement was pushing
westward with considerable rapidity, and stores of mineral wealth had
been discovered in Colorado. The railroad in those days had to create
its own traffic, and population followed the means of transportation.
The peculiarity of Kansas was a central position, which lent itself
to schemes of the most far-reaching nature. A railroad reaching from
one end of the state to the other might almost equally well have been
extended to California, to Chicago, or to the Gulf; and could be sure
in time, if it survived, of the carriage of a vast volume of traffic
out in every direction from the Central West. The Atchison managers
saw this opportunity, and courageously and persistently endeavored to
realize it;—part of the project they announced, and part they kept
back till the fitting time should come.</p>

<p>The systematic extension of the Atchison Railroad may be divided into
four parts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
(1) The construction through Kansas to Colorado, to save the charter,
then down the valley of the Rio Grande to Albuquerque.</p>

<p>(2) The securing of a connection with the Pacific Coast by
construction, lease, or traffic agreement.</p>

<p>(3) The connection with the Gulf.</p>

<p>(4) The connection with Chicago.</p>

<p>As the system neared completion, and its territory came to be invaded
by other roads, there were added to this systematic extension what
may be called competitive extensions, consisting largely in the
construction of branch lines, and multiplied beyond anything which
the country could need for years to come. This sort of building was
most prominent from 1884 to 1888 and will be considered in its place.</p>

<p>The first stretch of road was built with few difficulties or
complications. It was commenced in 1869, and, after numerous delays,
it reached the western border of the state of Kansas on December 28
of the same year; from this point it went on more leisurely, first
west and then southwest, to Albuquerque.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> These early miles were
paid for from the proceeds of both stocks and bonds. From Albuquerque
a variety of routes presented themselves. The Southern Pacific had
by that time built to El Paso, and it was feasible to extend the
Atchison to that point and to rely on a traffic agreement for the
handling of the western business. Or, building to Deming near El
Paso, Atchison might have extended its line down the river valleys in
the northwestern part of Mexico to Guaymas on the Gulf of California.
Or, Atchison might have built directly west from Albuquerque. All
three of these routes were considered, and all three were eventually
carried out.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>The connection with the Southern Pacific was not a very difficult
one to make, and the Atchison reached Deming in March, 1881. By
the traffic agreement then concluded the Atchison secured the use
of the Southern Pacific tracks from Deming to Benson, Arizona, and
arranged to build south into Mexico from this point; while the
Southern Pacific was allotted 51 per cent of the through rate on
traffic passing over Southern Pacific lines.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> This formed the
second through route from the East, and in September, 1881, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span> took
one-quarter as much business as the Central Pacific. It was also
the first of Atchison’s projected routes to be completed. The line
to Guaymas was added by purchase. Instead of building, Atchison
exchanged its stock for the stock of the already existing Sonora
Railroad in the proportion of one to two, and guaranteed the interest
on the Sonora first mortgage 7 per cent bonds.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> This made up
for the lack of an independent line to the coast further north. The
total of Sonora stock was $5,400,000, requiring $2,700,000 Atchison
stock in exchange. The total first mortgage 7 per cent bond issue
was $4,050,000. With the railroad came a subsidy of $2,608,200
(American gold), equal to $11,270 (Mexican) per mile. This subsidy
kept cropping up in Atchison finance for some time, and was finally
adjusted in 1896 by the transfer to the company of $1,159,800 in 3
per cent bonds of the Mexican Interior Consolidated Debt.</p>

<p>For the direct route President Strong sought the help of the St.
Louis &amp; San Francisco, and the use of the charter of the Atlantic
&amp; Pacific which it owned. The Atlantic &amp; Pacific was a road
incorporated in 1886, with a charter to build from St. Louis to
California. In spite both of its charter and of its name it had
never gone further west than Vinita, in the northeast corner of
Indian Territory.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> President Strong and the Frisco now agreed
to continue construction under the name of the Atlantic &amp; Pacific,
both from Vinita and from Albuquerque. The Atchison was to be given
a half-interest in the charter, directors were to be chosen equally
from the two companies, and the cost was to be met by a $25,000,000
loan, which the Atchison and the Frisco were to guarantee jointly but
not severally.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> Before the new construction neared completion,
however, the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco fell under the control of
Messrs. Gould and Huntington, who, as owners of the Texas &amp; Pacific
and the Southern Pacific respectively, naturally disapproved of the
plan to extend the Atlantic &amp; Pacific to the coast. The Atchison,
therefore, agreed to build no further west than the Colorado River.
At that point the Southern Pacific was to meet it with a line
from Mojave. The Southern Pacific gave to the Atlantic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span> &amp; Pacific
an interest guarantee on its bonds to the extent of 25 per cent
of the gross earnings derived from Atlantic &amp; Pacific through
business, and the latter road retained all its rights for a line in
California.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> This proved unprofitable, for the Southern Pacific
persistently diverted traffic to Ogden and El Paso, and in 1884 still
another arrangement was made. By <span class="locked">this—</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The Atlantic &amp; Pacific bought the Southern Pacific division
between the Needles (the Colorado River) and Mojave, 242 miles, for
$30,000 per mile, and, until such time as title could be given by the
discharge of the mortgage upon it, took a lease at an annual rental
of 6 per cent on the purchase price.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The Atlantic &amp; Pacific secured trackage and traffic rights and
facilities between Mojave and Oakland and San Francisco, as well as
the use of terminals at the latter point.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Atchison (and the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco likewise)
agreed to buy from the Pacific Improvement Company first mortgage
bonds and other securities of the Atlantic &amp; Pacific of the par value
of $3,096,768, at the actual cost to the Improvement Company, to wit,
$1,524,356.</p>

<p>To complete the connection to the coast the Atchison built from
Waterman, some seventy miles east of Mojave on the Atlantic &amp;
Pacific, to Colton on the Southern Pacific, and secured control
of the California Southern from Colton to San Diego.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> In 1885
entrance was obtained to Los Angeles by lease of the Southern Pacific
track between Colton and that city.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<p>The money for this rapid progress was obtained by the sale of both
stocks and bonds, but on the whole stock predominated. The directors
rightly considered it much more conservative to issue stock and
sell it at par than to load the road down with a heavy debt in the
shape of bonds; and what is more, they were able to make good their
word, and to sell stock at or near par in spite of the risk incident
to operations such as the Atchison was conducting and the frequent
bonuses or stock dividends declared.</p>

<p>By 1884, then, Atchison had reached the Pacific coast. The next great
steps were the extensions to Galveston and to Chicago. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span> year
of entrance to Los Angeles the Atchison did not cross the southern
boundary of Kansas. Certain of its stockholders were, however,
unofficially interested in the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe, which ran
from Galveston on the south to the Indian Territory on the north,
roughly 200 miles. In 1884 a charter was obtained for the Southern
Kansas Railway Company, a corporation organized solely to build south
from Arkansas City. The same year the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe
obtained permission to stretch north. The two roads met at Purcell
in the summer of 1887.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> In 1886 the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe
was formally brought in. Gulf stock then amounted to $4,560,000 and
bonds had been issued to a limit of $17,000 per mile. For the entire
capital stock, subject to the above encumbrance, Atchison agreed to
pay $8000 a mile in Atchison stock, par value.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> The final move
was to get into Chicago. “The Atchison Company has been much too
conservative during the last few years,” said the <cite>Chronicle</cite>, “and
thus has allowed its territory to be invaded.” The first intent was
to build direct. There were incorporated, in Illinois the Chicago,
Santa Fe &amp; California Railway Company, and in Iowa the Chicago, Santa
Fe &amp; California Railway Company of Iowa. In 1887 the Atchison was
able to purchase the Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railroad, between Chicago
and Streator, with a branch to Pekin,<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> and to save itself
construction between these points. The whole line was opened for
traffic in May, 1888.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></p>

<p>This completed Atchison’s systematic extensions before 1889. From a
local road in Kansas it had become a through route, taking freight
over its own rails from Chicago to Galveston and to the Pacific
coast. But especially in the latter eighties competition had become
keen; and to its strategic extensions Atchison was obliged to add
competitive building on an enormous scale. Of the 7000 miles in 1888,
over 2700 had been added since January, 1886, and had been built, not
to tap new sources of traffic, but to defend what was thought to be
Atchison’s rightful territory by means of a desperate war of rates.
“About three or four years ago,” said a competent observer, “a mania
seized three great corporations (Atchison, Missouri Pacific, and
Rock Island) to gridiron Kansas with railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span> iron, and each tried
hard to see which could cover the most ground, without regard to the
character of the ground, the result [being that] railroads were built
where they would not be required for ten years to come.”<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> Such
roads could not be expected to pay, and in fact did not. Even in the
case of better planned extensions, the lines had to be built in an
unopened territory, the traffic of which had yet to be developed. In
Indian Territory, Oklahoma, and Arizona, the bulk of the country had
less than two inhabitants to the square mile; in New Mexico and Lower
California only one-half of the area was more thickly settled; and it
was largely from this southwestern corner that local traffic for the
Atchison had to be built up.</p>

<p>The method of financiering these competitive extensions varied:
sometimes the parent company guaranteed the principal and interest
of the branch-line bonds; sometimes it took these into its treasury
and issued collateral bonds against them; sometimes, perhaps more
frequently still, it leased new roads for a rental equivalent to the
annual interest on their bonds. If the branches could have earned
their fixed charges the burden on the Atchison would have been
nominal, but as in large part they could not it was real and serious.
In 1888 there were actually paid in rentals, interest on Sonora
Railway bonds, and on sundry railway bonds, $2,361,300. Large sums
were carried to capital account. In 1888 there was an accumulated
account of “due from sundry leased, controlled, and auxiliary roads
in construction and general account” (net) $13,558,678, including
various cash current construction and other charges, which was
carried as an asset, but which in reality consisted of advances from
which there was little or no hope of return. Besides the claims for
interest the parent company had in practice other claims to meet.
Where a branch failed to earn operating expenses, as often happened,
sums had to be advanced to keep the road and rolling stock in
repair. Thus the item “due from auxiliary roads in current traffic
and operation accounts” amounted in 1888 to $1,008,554. Bills and
accounts payable the same year were $6,553,775, and accrued interest,
taxes, and sinking funds totalled $915,337. The following table shows
vividly the effect upon the system of the rapid extension of the
years 1884 to 1888:</p>

<p>Whatever may be said as to the necessity of extension, it is evident
that the position of the system by 1888 had changed for the worse.
This last-named year was a bad one, it is true, but certain evils of
which the directors then complained were permanent, and should have
been permanently allowed for. Some realization of the fact that the
Atchison might be going too fast appeared in the financial journals
of the time. “Were these undertakings less solidly backed,” said
the <cite>Railway Age</cite>, “there might be apprehension that enterprise was
being pushed too far and too fast.”<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> But on the whole the rapid
growth and enormous extent of the system seem to dazzle beholders.
“The career of this company,” said the <cite>Railway Age</cite> again, “has been
one of the marvels of railway enterprise, and it would be unsafe now
to attempt to fix a limit to its extension or to the ambition of its
Napoleonic president and its bold and enterprising directors.”<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></p>

<p>In 1887 the directors increased the rate of dividend from 6 to 7 per
cent.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> The action was thoroughly unjustifiable, and the rate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
was speedily again reduced. By the end of 1888 the main company was
liable to be called on any year to the extent of $8,625,365, which
was the amount of interest on auxiliary roads either guaranteed or
payable as rentals. In four years the mileage of the Atchison system
had increased 150 per cent; its bonded indebtedness 239 per cent; its
fixed charges 216 per cent; and its gross earnings only 69 per cent;
while the deficits on its branch lines were obviously not matters of
bookkeeping, and the value of interchanged business was not equal
to the increased burdens which the subsidiary lines imposed. The
floating debt mounted up, as is usual in times of trouble. From a
total of $3,317,446 in 1884 it increased to $8,076,059 in 1888. To
offset it the directors secured in October, 1888, subscriptions
to a $10,000,000 issue of “guarantee fund,” three-year notes. Not
all of the amount authorized was to be sold at once, but from time
to time Atchison was to call on subscribers to take part of their
subscription, and the notes were to bear 6 per cent from the time
they were put forth.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> For the rest, the directors economized as
much as possible. Salaries were cut 10 per cent in every branch of
the service, beginning with the president, and the unlucky 7 per cent
rate of dividend was reduced to 6 per cent, to 2 per cent, and then
to nothing at all in successive quarters. None of these expedients
proved sufficient. In fact, the situation was so critical that
nothing short of a general reorganization could probably have secured
the radical reduction in fixed charges which the company required.</p>

<p>In September, 1889, accordingly, Messrs. Libby, Abbott, Peabody,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
and Baring were appointed a committee to consider the broad question
of financial and general reorganization,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> and in October a plan
for the complete rehabilitation of the company was brought forward.
The obligations with which the plan had to deal are indicated in the
following table:</p>

<p>Of the bonds outstanding $56,498,000 were direct loans upon the
Atchison’s main lines, bearing anywhere from 4½ to 7 per cent, and
$104,288,000 were bonds upon some of the thirty-two subsidiary
corporations for whose obligations the Atchison was responsible.</p>

<p>The dealing of the Libby Committee with this situation was
intelligent and comprehensive. It proposed an increase and
simplification of securities, a decrease in fixed charges, and
a cancellation of the floating debt. In place of the forty-one
classes of bonds outstanding it suggested that two grand issues be
put forth, one of 4 per cent general mortgage bonds to the amount
of $150,000,000, and one of 5 per cent income bonds to a total of
$80,000,000. From these issues $13,750,000 should be used to provide
for cash requirements,<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> and the remainder should be employed
in direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span> retirement of old obligations. The exchange of some
$216,000,000 of new bonds for $163,000,000 of old was to mean an
increase in securities outstanding, but since interest on only part
of the new bonds was to be obligatory fixed charges were to be less
than they had been before. The managers figured on what the property
could earn, good times or bad, and capitalized this sum into 4 per
cent general mortgage bonds. They then calculated the difference
between this and the former return to bondholders, and capitalized
the difference into income bonds.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> Each individual bondholder,
therefore, was offered a chance to receive the same return which
he had previously enjoyed, although his right to demand an annual
payment was limited to an amount which the road could earn.</p>

<p>A few points deserve to be specially noticed. The reduction in
interest was sufficient to have transformed the deficit for the
whole Atchison system for 1888 into a respectable surplus, providing
that no dividends had been paid; but this reduction was dependent
on the retention of the income bonds as optional obligations. There
was no cash assessment. Had the reorganization taken place in a
time of general depression, the sale of securities for cash would
probably have been impossible, but the days of depression had not
yet arrived. The stockholder suffered in the introduction of the
principal of some $67,000,000 additional indebtedness between him and
his property, although he was not called upon directly; but it should
not be forgotten that for a long while the Atchison stockholders had
received very liberal dividends, both in stock and in cash, and could
not well complain of the moderate loss now necessary. There was no
voting trust, although one was proposed, and the bonds were not even
temporarily given voting power. The situation seems to have been that
the securityholders thought it more to their advantage to reduce
voluntarily the rate of interest than to force a foreclosure sale and
take their chances; for the directors, in submitting the plan, said
that they felt it necessary “to state in the strongest terms that the
non-success of this proposal will inevitably result in foreclosure,
with all its attendant misfortunes.”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
By the end of November, although the plan had not been promulgated
until well into October, more than one-half of the outstanding bonds
had assented, and the directors were enabled to announce success.
Certain changes in the management had already taken place. President
Strong had resigned in September, and had been succeeded by Mr. Allen
Manville, general manager of the St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba
Railway.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> Mr. Reinhart was credited with a large part in the
construction of the new plan of 1889, and his later promotion may
have been connected therewith.</p>

<p>After the reorganization Atchison resumed its policy of expansion,
its new directors being apparently as “bold and enterprising” as the
old. In 1890 it took in the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco, a road running
from St. Louis west and southwest through Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas,
and Indian Territory, connecting at Paris, Texas, with the Gulf,
Colorado &amp; Santa Fe, and through half-ownership of the Atlantic &amp;
Pacific connecting Albuquerque in New Mexico with Barstow in Southern
California. The total length of the Frisco system, exclusive of
jointly owned roads, was 1329 miles, and this constituted the largest
single acquisition that the Atchison had ever made. The terms of the
purchase were highly favorable to the Frisco shareholders, but the
benefits to the Atchison were less than was expected. Although the
consolidation removed certain difficulties experienced from the joint
ownership of the Atlantic &amp; Pacific, and although the united roads
were in a better position to compete for transcontinental and Gulf
traffic than either of them had been before, the Atchison directors
were forced to announce in 1891 that, “with every opportunity given
it to work with advantage, the property (Frisco) has failed to
demonstrate its ability to carry itself financially and to liquidate
its debts; nor could it hope to obtain such results without the
provision of New Capital.... This is due largely to the absence of
complete and proper facilities and machinery with which to conduct
operations in the nature of Round Houses, Machine Shops, Stations and
other buildings, improved Bridges and Equipment.”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> A bond issue
was needed, and was in fact put forth,—the Atchison taking a goodly
share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Less important than this was the purchase, in 1890, of the Colorado
Midland, a road 346 miles long in Colorado, valued chiefly for
its ore traffic. In August, 1890, the Mexican Government resumed
payment of the Sonora subsidy, on which nothing had been paid for
eight years.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> It does not seem as if at any time after 1889
the Atchison enjoyed unalloyed prosperity. The year 1890 showed an
increase in net earnings of 48 per cent according to the figures
given, and the directors were unhappy until they had increased the
fixed charges to match, but the year 1891 recorded a falling off, and
1892 showed a comparatively slight gain over the figures of 1891.
There was obviously nothing in the reported figures to cause alarm,
but there was nothing which justified the payment of more than 2¾ per
cent any year on the income bonds, or of any dividends on the stock.</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1891 the guarantee fund notes fell due. They had
been issued, it will be remembered, to protect the property in
1888, and were secured by an equal amount of general mortgage 4s;
but now the directors, disliking to put these 4s on the market at
83¼, decided to extend the notes for two years at par with a cash
commission of one per cent.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>

<p>Extension of the guarantee fund notes did not increase the fixed
obligations, it merely postponed a reduction; but the conversion of
the income bonds of 1889 acted as a positive increase. There were
$80,000,000 of these incomes, and it was in the optional character
of payments upon them that the saving of fixed charges by the
reorganization of 1889 had consisted. They had been issued instead of
preferred stock probably because more acceptable to the bondholders;
but it was early found that their use involved difficulties which had
not been sufficiently regarded. By the conditions of their indenture
no bonds could be inserted between them and the general mortgage 4s;
they held a second lien for all time. But similarly it was difficult
to put bonds after them. Their lien was on income,—interest was
payable only when earned; any regular mortgage would of necessity
have taken precedence. The hindrance to new issues was real and
serious, and although some check on an aggressive management was
salutary, yet the system required additions and improvements from
time to time which could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span> be supplied from current income.
Under these circumstances the Atchison directors decided within
three years to sacrifice the reduction in fixed charges secured in
1889 in order to obtain new capital with greater ease. “It is the
opinion of the Management,” said the annual report for 1892, “that
the time has now arrived when all the obligations of the Company
can be returned to a Fixed Basis, sufficient funds provided to take
care of all Improvements ... required for at least four years, and
at the same time the junior Bonds and Capital Stock be restored to
a more permanent market value with assured returns on the first,
and probable balances for the latter.”<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> “The Atchison plan
of conversion,” said Mr. Reinhart, “... is the completion of the
reorganization plan put in effect October 18, 1889, and returns the
obligations of the company ... to a fixed and stable basis....”<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<p>The plan so cordially referred to provided for the issue of a new,
second mortgage, 4 per cent bond, and the exchange of this security
for the outstanding income bonds. The second mortgage was to be
issued in two classes:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) $80,000,000. These were to exchange for income 5s, par for par,
and bore a rate of interest which increased from 2½ per cent in 1892
to 4 per cent in 1896, and then remained at 4 per cent until maturity.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) $20,000,000. These bore 4 per cent and were to be issued in no
greater sum in any year than $5,000,000 for specific improvements on
the Atchison exclusive of the Colorado Midland or the St. Louis &amp; San
Francisco. There was reserved to the company the right, when all the
above should have been exhausted, to issue more bonds of the same
sort as in class B for the same purposes and on the same mileage, up
to a limit of $50,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p>The conversion plan was approved at the annual meeting in 1892,
and was put into effect. The result was most unfortunate. The
annual burden on the company was increased at the very time when
the panic of 1893 was about to reduce railroad earnings, while the
advantages of freer issues of new bonds were of little account in
a year when the sale of new securities was practically impossible.
Moreover, a new light was soon to be thrown on the whole operation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
by disclosures of dishonest manipulation of figures in the Atchison
reports.</p>

<p>In 1892 and 1893 rumors of trouble were afloat, and were repeatedly
and vigorously denied by Mr. Reinhart, president of the Atchison
Company. Thus in June, 1893, this officer declared that “the
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad Company, strictly speaking, has
no floating debt. Its current liabilities are more than equalled by
its current cash assets.”<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> In December Mr. Reinhart said again:
“The interest on the General Mortgage Bonds of the Atchison Company,
due January 1, will be paid. It seems hardly necessary to make this
statement, because doubts as to its payment have, in my judgment,
been created solely by speculators who have no substantial interest
in the property.” These official denials did not carry conviction,
but opinions varied as to the seriousness of the situation. The
<cite>Boston News Bureau</cite> cheerily insisted that all the Atchison needed
was “days of grace” during the existing depression,<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> while in
England it was thought that the rumors of a receivership were at most
but premature.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>At the end of the year President Reinhart went to Europe to float
a loan. On his return, after a failure to obtain subscriptions, a
receivership was applied for and granted. It had been hoped up to
the very last moment that the January interest could be met; but
the refusal of English bondholders to subscribe additional capital,
the failure to place a third mortgage loan in the United States,
and the death of Director Magoun, one of the strong influences in
Atchison’s affairs, made a crash inevitable. Current obligations
had mounted to over $10,000,000, credit had disappeared, and the
railroad necessarily succumbed. The Atlantic &amp; Pacific, the Colorado
Midland, the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe, and the Southern California
lines were not included in the Atchison receivership, though the
Atchison receivers were given like office in respect to the Atlantic
&amp; Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> The Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe announced that it would
continue to operate its own line, and was prepared to pay its current
obligations as before.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
No sooner was failure announced than committees of bondholders sprang
up. In Boston a committee was formed with six members, including
J. L. Thorndike and H. L. Higginson. In New York the Union Trust
Company, the Mercantile Trust Company, the New York Life Insurance
Company, Baring, Magoun &amp; Co., and Giddes &amp; Smith got together in a
committee, with Edward King as chairman. A second New York committee,
R. Somers Hayes, chairman, was formed by express invitation of the
road. A directors’ committee was organized, of which E. B. Cheney,
Jr., was chairman. The London holders of the second mortgage class A
bonds themselves formed a committee. Even before 1888 Englishmen had
invested heavily in Atchison, attracted perhaps by glowing stories
of the business to spring up across the western plains. It was said
that not only had they been influential in shaping the reorganization
of 1889, but that from that date to 1893 the management had been
controlled by a board elected by proxies entrusted to representatives
of English interest. In particular Englishmen had become interested
in the second mortgage bonds of 1892, successors to the income bonds
of 1889, holding about one-half of the total issue, and they now
fought for the protection of this issue as against the stock.</p>

<p>A plan of reorganization was early matured after the English
influence substantially as follows: Either the general mortgage or
the second mortgage bonds were to be foreclosed and a new company
was to be formed. If the foreclosure should be under the general
mortgage, overdue interest on that mortgage was not to be paid, and
new securities, similar to the existing bonds, were to be issued,
bond for bond. If the foreclosure should be under the second
mortgage, the company was to provide for past due interest, and
was to assume the payment of principal and interest on the general
mortgage bonds. The capital stock was to remain as before. There was
to be a new income mortgage to the amount of $115,000,000, of which
$84,000,000 were to go for the existing second mortgage A bonds, and
$5,600,000 for the existing B bonds; the surplus to be given for
assessments, or for the securities of such auxiliary companies as
it should be thought advisable to acquire. These income bonds were
to bear 5 per cent and were to have voting power. There was to be
a second mortgage, to amount eventually to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span> $35,000,000; of which
$5,000,000 were to be used at once to retire the floating debt and
for other purposes, and $3,000,000 were to be used each year for
improvements. The new stock was to be held in trust until 5 per cent
per annum should have been paid in cash on the new income bonds for
three consecutive years. Finally there was to be an assessment of $12
per share upon the stockholders, the proceeds of which were to go
as far as necessary to pay the debts of the old company, including
interest on the general mortgage.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>On the whole, the scheme was to put the Atchison back to the
condition of 1889, and to regain the margin of safety afforded by the
income bonds. So far it was acceptable enough. Conservative officers
had looked askance at the income bond conversion in 1892, and this
was a simple acknowledgment of the mistake. The old difficulty as
to future capital requirements, moreover, was evaded by a provision
for an annual increment of second mortgage bonds to take precedence
of the incomes. The notable part of the scheme was the anxious care
of the bondholders to protect themselves. Since their bonds had
been converted from income bonds less than two years before they
could not claim a large allowance for the reconversion; but as a
condition of their assent to this and to the introduction of a second
mortgage for $35,000,000 before their lien they demanded not only a
bonus of 5 per cent in the new incomes for their holdings, but the
grant of voting power to the income bonds, a stock assessment of
$12 per share, and the interposition of an additional $5,000,000 of
bonds between the stock and the property of which it was nominally
the possessor. “It is true,” said the <cite>Railway Review</cite>, “that the
scheme contemplates the issue of income bonds which shall be given
to assenting stockholders at par in return for the cash assessment,
but it is a little difficult to see wherein such bonds are of very
much more value than the stock of the company except that they
are not subject to assessment.”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> The reception of the plan
was what might have been expected. On July 30, in London, the
London bondholders’ committee met and passed a resolution in its
favor. Having now secured, they said in substance, the substantial
features for which they had contended, and although the plan was not
altogether what they could have desired, they considered, after very
prolonged and anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span> negotiations, that a plan had been arrived at
which was the best obtainable in the interests of bondholders.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a>
Meanwhile meetings of stockholders were held in New York in protest.
Resolutions were adopted condemning the plan, and a stockholders’
committee was chosen.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<p>Debate was stopped by the publication in August of the report of an
expert who had been selected to examine the books of the Atchison
Company. Few more disgraceful instances of the juggling of figures
have been brought to light in the history of American railroad
finance. Whereas the reports of the company had shown net earnings
steadily increasing from $7,600,000 in 1890 to $12,100,000 in 1893,
being ample to meet existing charges and to pay from 2 to 2¾ per cent
on the income bonds besides to the time of their conversion, Mr.
Little, the expert, reported that the net earnings had never exceeded
$8,085,608; and maintained that an annual deficit had occurred each
year from 1894, which reached the portentous amount of $3,000,000 for
1891 alone. The condition of the company was far worse than had been
imagined, and all plans had to be thoroughly recast. The following is
an abstract of the report in question:</p>

<p>“I have already advised you verbally,” said Mr. Little, “that income
was, in my judgment, overstated in these several years (since
’89), to the extent of $7,000,000 or more, and I now confirm this
specifically. These overstatements may be classified as follows:</p>

<p>“(1) <i>Rebates.</i> For the four years ending June 30, 1894, the debits
for rebates to shippers on the Atchison system aggregated $3,700,776,
and on the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco system $205,879, or a total of
$3,906,656.</p>

<p>“This sum was charged, not to the earnings from whence it came, as it
should have been, but to an account entitled, ‘<cite>Auditor’s Suspended
Account-Special</cite>,’ and was reported from year to year as a good and
available asset, while in fact it had no value whatsoever.</p>

<p>“(2) <i>Additions to Earnings and Deductions from Expenses.</i> Next in
order of importance to the rebate account comes an aggregate of
$2,791,000, which, on instructions from the East, was credited from
time to time to the earnings and expenses respectively, but which
credit has no foundation in fact. Of this aggregate $2,010,000 was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
added to earnings and $781,000 deducted from operating expenses, the
sum of the two being debited to ‘<i>Auditor’s Suspended Account</i>.’</p>

<p>“(3) <i>Improvements.</i> The sum of $488,000 was in the period under
consideration transferred, improperly as I contend, from Operating
Expenses to Improvements or Capital Account, these Improvements being
finally closed into the account of Franchises and Property, which
represents the cost of the road and property.</p>

<p>“(4) <i>Traffic Balances.</i> It further appears that a traffic agreement
for a division of business was formed in November, 1890 (running
to July, 1891), between the Atchison Company and certain other
companies, whereby such other companies were charged with a balance
of $305,843, which the Atchison Company was unable to collect, and
which is absolutely uncollectable, and should have been heretofore
written off, though it still stands as an asset, and hence must be
written to the debit of profit and loss.”<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></p>

<p>Two facts appear from these charges on which emphasis was laid from
different points of view: (1) That for four years the Atchison had
been persistently violating the law by the granting of rebates. (2)
That to conceal these rebates, and for other purposes, the books
had been so systematically falsified as to defy detection, and to
deceive not only the investing public but the whole railroad world.
The report was handed to Mr. Reinhart, and an answer was requested by
the following day. The answer was made, and proved inadequate; for
though Mr. Reinhart pointed out some half-dozen items which he argued
that Mr. Little had wrongly excluded, he explained no one of the
charges directly brought against him.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> There is no doubt at the
present time that Mr. Reinhart was guilty, though perhaps because of
the difficulty of fixing legal responsibility he was never prosecuted
for falsification of the books. He resigned, of course, and Major
Aldace F. Walker was appointed receiver in his stead. Two months
later he was indicted with other officers of the company and certain
shippers, not for falsifying the books, but for the illegal granting
of rebates. His defence was that he had been, at the time the rebates
were given, only the general auditor at Boston, and had had no part
in the fiscal or executive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span> business of the road.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> The Government
failed to prove connection, and the case fell through.</p>

<p>All this completely altered the requirements to be met by a
reorganization plan. A more sweeping reduction in charges, and a
more general distribution of losses was needed than before had been
the case. Old proposals were laid aside once and for all, and a new
scheme was built up from the beginning. The mortgage indebtedness of
the Atchison in 1895 was $233,595,247, of which the first and second
mortgage bonds comprised $217,258,276. The reorganization of 1889
had done its work in one respect at least, and the reorganization
managers were able to concentrate their attention on two issues. The
annual net earnings, according to the company’s reports had been:</p>

<p class="in0">it was very evident that a reduction in interest charges was
called for. As in 1889 the salvation of the company was sought in
the substitution of securities on which payment was optional for
securities bearing an obligatory charge.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Little’s final report in November three of the
existing committees, namely, the General Reorganization Committee,
the London Committee, and Messrs. Hope &amp; Co. of Amsterdam, joined
in a Joint Executive Reorganization Committee, with Edward King
as chairman.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> With these now worked a committee chosen by the
directors themselves. The result was a reorganization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span> plan under
date of March 14, 1895. The purposes announced were:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To reduce fixed charges to a safe limit;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To make adequate provision for future capital requirements,
subject to proper restrictions as to issue of bonds for this purpose;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To liquidate the floating debt, and to make adequate provision
for existing prior lien indebtedness shortly to mature;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) To reinstate existing securities upon equitable terms in their
order of priority;</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) To consolidate and unify the system (so far as practicable) and
thus to save large annual expense.</p>

<p>It was proposed to foreclose the Atchison general mortgage ... and to
vest in a railway company the bonds, stocks, and other properties of
the existing company, acquired at foreclosure sale or otherwise. The
new company was to issue:</p>

<table summary="new issues">

    <td class="tdl">(<i>a</i>) Common Stock</td>
    <td class="tdr">$102,000,000     </td>

</table>

<p>Of the above the interest on only the general mortgage bonds was
to be a fixed charge;—the stock obviously got a return only when
earned, and the adjustment bonds were income bonds in fact if not
in name. Additional issues to a comparatively small aggregate were
provided for, but no mortgage, other than the general and adjustment
mortgages, was to be executed by the company, nor was the amount
of preferred stock to be increased, unless the execution of such
mortgage, or such increase of preferred stock, should have received
the consent of the holders of a majority of the whole amount of
preferred stock at the time outstanding, given at a meeting of
the stockholders called for that purpose, and the consent of the
holders of a majority of such part of the common stock as should
be represented at said meeting. The securities mentioned were to
retire all previously existing issues. Old common stockholders
were to receive share for share in the common stock of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span> new
company. They were to be assessed $10 per share, and to receive
for the assessment $10 in new preferred stock, while a syndicate
guaranteed payment of assessments by engaging to take the place
of non-assenting or defaulting stockholders. The general mortgage
bondholders were to get 75 per cent of their holdings in new general
mortgage 4s and 40 per cent in adjustment 4s. The second mortgage
and income bondholders were to be assessed 4 per cent and were to
get new preferred stock.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> The prior lien bondholders were dealt
with separately, and were to be paid either in general mortgage 4s
of the additional issues (over the $96,990,582) mentioned, or in
the new prior lien bonds. If in the latter, the general mortgage
bonds which would otherwise have been issued were to be held for the
ultimate retirement of these bonds. Provision was made for future
construction and additions by the allowance of $3,000,000 general
mortgage bonds, to be issued each year to a limit of $30,000,000,
and then of $2,000,000 adjustment bonds, to be issued each year to a
limit of $20,000,000. Additional new general mortgage bonds, up to
$20,000,000, might be issued and used in such amounts respectively
and in such proportions as the Joint Executive Committee might
determine, for the acquisition of the Atlantic &amp; Pacific, the St.
Louis &amp; San Francisco, and the Colorado Midland; and for like
purposes $20,000,000 preferred stock. The lien of the new general
mortgage was to cover all properties which should be vested in the
new company, and also any other property which might be acquired
by use of any of the new bonds, but the Joint Executive Committee
might, in its discretion, except from the new general mortgage the
stocks and bonds deposited under the existing general mortgage,
representing branch lines, the operation of which should be found to
be unprofitable and an unnecessary burden to the system. A voting
trust was considered, but was rejected as unsatisfactory; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
committee confined its efforts to the securing of the best possible
management.</p>

<p>This reorganization had certain interesting features. As before
remarked, it sought, as did the reorganization of 1889, to replace
securities, the interest on which was a fixed charge, by securities
on which payment of interest or dividends should be optional. But
whereas the earlier reorganization had depended on income bonds,
this plan included both income bonds and preferred stock. There are
several reasons why preferred stock is preferable to income bonds,
and it will be remembered that a peculiar difficulty experienced
from the income bonds of 1889 had arisen from the impossibility
of putting other mortgages ahead of them; yet that this was not
the chief obstacle sought to be avoided by the use of preferred
stock at this later date appears from the current use of adjustment
bonds. Provision for future capital requirements was in fact made
in another way, and the question was not here involved. So far
as the acceptability of the income bonds and the preferred stock
respectively to the old bondholders was concerned, it should be noted
that the men who received the greater part of the new issue were
the holders of the old income and second mortgage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span> bonds; that is,
Englishmen who had already shown their preference for income bonds
as opposed to stock. The chief reason for the new expedient seems to
have been the desire to retain for the general mortgage holders a
priority of lien, while reducing part of their holdings to the level
of an optional obligation. If income bonds or preferred stock alone
had been used, these would necessarily have been given to the owners
both of general mortgage and of second mortgage or old income bonds;
so that the former might have received a larger amount, but not any
lien different in kind. By the scheme proposed, all possible interest
on the securities given for old mortgage 4s was to be met before
anything was to be paid on the equivalent of issues which had been
inferior before the reorganization took place. Abundant provision
was made for future capital requirements. That lesson had been
learned once for all. Cash requirements were met by an assessment.
In speaking of the reorganization of 1889 the rule was laid down
that the disposal of securities for cash is impossible except at
an enormous sacrifice in a time of general depression. There was
widespread depression in 1895, and the reorganization managers wisely
made no attempt to negotiate a sale. The amount of the assessment on
the common stock was very considerably above the quoted price of the
shares, but it was correctly figured that the hope of future increase
in value would be sufficient to induce stockholders to furnish the
sums required. Not to tax them too heavily call was made also on the
junior securities. On the whole, the decrease of $5,000,000 in fixed
charges more than compensated the stockholders for the additional
obligations put between them and their property; their claim on the
road itself was made more remote, but their chances for dividends
were improved. Examination of the plan shows clearly that nothing was
taken from either bonds or stock which those securities had a right
to retain. The bondholders could not, in any case, have received more
than the earnings of the road; and an amount equal to the return
previously due them was assured, whenever the road should earn it,
by the new combination of mortgage and income bonds and preferred
stock. As it was, in return for an assessment they retained the right
to participate in any future prosperity, a right which has proved of
extreme value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
The plan was underwritten by Messrs. Baring Bros. &amp; Co. and other
strong foreign and American bankers, who assumed the liability of
paying the assessment and of taking the stock.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> The comment
at the time was favorable. “On the whole,” said the <cite>Railway
Age</cite>, “we do not believe that any one who is acquainted with the
properties could have expected a more satisfactory plan than that
which the committee has evolved.”<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> The London bondholders
promptly accepted the plan. “We are disposed,” said the <cite>Railway
Times</cite> of London, “to regard the latest of Atchison reorganization
schemes as a praiseworthy attempt to grapple with a very thorny
problem.”<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> Such opposition as there was came from a minority of
the stockholders, and was directed at two points: the prevention of
foreclosure, and the inauguration of an entirely new administration.
It was asserted that certain old members of the board of directors
who had been forced to resign by the earlier disclosures, had
nevertheless secured the election of successors to perpetuate
their policy and to protect their interest. With a directory so
constituted, it was maintained that the stockholders would have no
guarantee of important changes in the executive offices, financial
policies, or business methods of the company.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> Sharp criticism
was directed to a statement of the existing board which referred to
the “mistakes and misfortunes of the previous management.” “Only
those who believe,” said the Stockholders’ Protective Committee,
“that gross irregularities, if not worse, have been perpetrated ...
may be relied upon to probe to the bottom the acts of the former
officers of the Atchison.”<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> On the other hand, the accusations
of the committee were asserted by the directors to be unqualifiedly
false.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> It soon became apparent that the opposition could not
muster enough votes to control an election, and although their fight
had been begun in August, they had proxies by November for only
250,000 out of the 1,020,000 shares of stock. Recourse was had to
the courts, and an attempt was made to secure at least a minority
representation on the coming board by the enforcement of a provision
for cumulative voting embodied in a Kansas law of 1879. This failed
in November, 1894, and no further obstacle to reorganization was
encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Practically all of the assessments were paid in by September 21. On
November 25 Mr. E. P. Ripley was elected president, and in the first
week of December, 1895, Mr. Aldace F. Walker was elected chairman of
the board of directors of the new company. On December 10, 1895, the
property and franchises of the Atchison were sold at foreclosure, and
were purchased for $60,000,000 by Edward King, Charles C. Beaman, and
Victor Morawetz, representing the reorganization committee.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> The
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad Company was then organized by
the purchasers pursuant to the laws of Kansas, under a certificate
of incorporation dated December 12, 1895. A board of directors was
elected, and by-laws were adopted. The entire estate embraced in the
foreclosure sale was duly conveyed by deed of the same date as the
incorporation of the company, in consideration of which the company
executed a delivery to the Joint Executive Reorganization Committee
of the securities acquired under the plan of reorganization. Certain
subsidiary roads were subsequently foreclosed and bought in, notably
the Atlantic &amp; Pacific and the Chicago, Santa Fe &amp; California. The
St. Louis &amp; San Francisco was not so bought in. “The question of
retaining the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco as a part of the Atchison
system,” said the annual report of 1896, “received very careful
consideration from the Directors.... A series of conferences was
held, which resulted in the matter ultimately presenting the
alternative of the sale of our existing interest upon favorable
terms, or the purchase by us of all other outstanding interests
upon terms involving the outlay of a very large amount of both cash
and securities. While the future control of that road was regarded
as important, the financial considerations affecting the situation
prevailed, and the sale was decided on the whole to be more prudent
than the purchase.” “With the acquisition of the Frisco,” said Mr.
Fleming of the Joint Executive Committee, “the fixed charges on the
Atchison system of 7780 miles would have been increased from $7000 to
$9000 per mile. Atchison is financially much stronger without Frisco.”</p>

<p>This ends that part of the history of the Atchison Company which
can be connected with either of its reorganizations. From 1895 to
the present time the Atchison has enjoyed a rapidly increasing
prosperity, due in part to the lightening of the charges upon it,
in part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span> to able management, and in part to the great increase in
volume of business which has been a characteristic of the time.
One or two things may be noted. A final settlement has been made
of the relations between the Southern Pacific and the Atchison in
the Southwest. It will be remembered that the final result of the
negotiations in 1882 had been the purchase of the former Mojave
division from the Needles to Mojave, but that since title could
not be acquired until the maturity of the outstanding mortgages,
Atchison had leased this track at an annual rental of 6 per cent on
the purchase price. In 1897 this rental was cancelled. The Southern
Pacific could not even then give a clear title, but exchanged a long
time lease of the Mojave division against a similar lease of the
Sonora Railway, the Atchison branch which reached from Deming to
Guaymas. The rentals cancelled each other, and the actual transfer
is eventually to take place.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> The arrangement is mutually
advantageous. On the one hand the Mojave division formed a spur
of the Southern Pacific, and on the other the Sonora Railway was
totally disconnected from the Atchison, so that the latter company
was obliged to use the Southern Pacific’s tracks to reach the
property at all. In 1898 Chairman Walker of the Executive Committee
was able to announce the substantial completion of negotiations for
the purchase of the San Francisco &amp; San Joaquin Valley Railroad,
running from Bakersfield to Stockton, California; the former town
being sixty-eight miles from Mojave and the latter something less
than that from San Francisco.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> Atchison at once began building
at the Stockton end, and reached San Francisco the following year.
The Santa Fe Terminal Company was then incorporated with a capital
stock of $1,000,000, Atchison secured a traffic contract with the
Southern Pacific, and through freight trains were run from Chicago
to San Francisco on May 1, 1900, through passenger trains following
two months later. Besides this there have been important extensions
in Arizona and New Mexico. In 1901 the Atchison purchased two-thirds
of the bonds, and practically all of the capital stock of the Pecos
Valley &amp; Northeastern Railway Company, stretching 370 miles from
Texico through the southeastern corner of New Mexico to Pecos City,
Texas. In July of the same year it bought the Santa Fe, Prescott
&amp; Phœnix Railroad, from Ash Fork, Arizona, to Phœnix, Arizona,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
some 195 miles. Construction has been practically completed between
Belen, New Mexico, a few miles south of Albuquerque, and Amarillo,
Texas, to afford an alternative and somewhat shorter route from
California to Eastern Kansas. A still more noteworthy project is
under consideration for a road to join the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa
Fe at Brownwood with the Belen line at Texico, and to open direct
connection over the Atchison from California to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, the Atchison’s mileage has increased from 6479
miles in 1897, to 9273 in 1907. Its gross earnings have grown from
$30,621,230 to $93,683,407; its net earnings from $7,754,041 to
$32,153,692; and its surplus above all charges from $1,452,446 to
$21,168,724. This marvellous showing has been accompanied by heavy
expenditures for improvements, so that the physical condition of
the system is much better than before. Operating expenses, fixed
charges, and taxes took less than 77 per cent of gross income in
1907, and a decline of over $21,000,000 can be suffered in net before
interest on even the adjustment bonds becomes imperilled. It is not
to be wondered at that Mr. Harriman saw fit to invest $10,395,000 of
Union Pacific money in Atchison preferred stock in 1906,<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> nor
that dividends of 5 per cent on preferred, and 5 per cent on common
stock are being paid. The Atchison owns 1791 locomotives instead of
953 as in 1897; 1135 passenger cars instead of 622; 49,770 freight
cars instead of 26,776. There has been a large increase in the
capacity and power of rolling stock. The average freight train load
has increased from 131 to 320 tons. Freight train mileage has grown
but 35 per cent, while ton mileage has more than tripled. Thus,
although the average length of haul has increased and the average
receipts per ton mile have diminished, the earnings per freight train
mile are actually more than double in 1907 what they were in 1897.
And, finally, the Atchison is not dependent for its revenue upon
any single kind of business. Coal, ore, and other mineral products
yielded but 30.87 per cent of its tonnage in 1907; products of
agriculture 25.34 per cent; manufactures 17.37 per cent; and products
of the forest 12.12 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
The capital account, meanwhile, has been kept from undue expansion.
The funded debt has increased from $174,196,750 in 1897 to
$284,171,550 in 1907, but the capital stock has decreased somewhat,
and the greater part of the new bond issues have been convertible
serial debenture bonds, which occasion no permanent increase
in charges. It is within the last two years only that Atchison
stockholders have authorized the issue of new capital on a scale
commensurate with the growth of their property. In 1906 $26,060,000
in 4 per cent convertible bonds were offered to them at par, and this
last year they have authorized the issue of $98,000,000 of common
stock for improvements, extensions, and the like. This provides ample
facilities for the future without endangering the solvency of the
road.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> construction of the Union Pacific was made possible by direct
grants of lands and government bonds by Congress. The motive for the
project was military and political as well as economic; on the one
hand California was to be cemented to the Union, and aggression on
the part of England was to be forestalled; on the other a great and
fertile territory was to be opened and an additional market provided
for the products of the East.</p>

<p>In 1862 the first act “to aid in the construction of a Railroad and
Telegraph Line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to
secure to the Government the Use of the same for Postal, Military,
and Other Purposes” was passed.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a>. It created a corporation to
be known as the Union Pacific Railroad Company, with a capital of
100,000 shares of $1000 each, and authorized it to construct a
railroad from the one hundredth meridian of longitude west from
Greenwich at a point within the territory of Nebraska westward to the
western boundary of the territory of Nevada. It granted the right of
way, and in addition five additional sections per mile on each side
of the track, plus a varying amount of United States bonds per mile,
the use and delivery of which was to constitute a first mortgage on
the property of the company. All compensation for services rendered
to the Government was to be applied to the payment of these bonds
and interest thereon; and after the road was completed, until the
bonds and interest should have been paid, at least 5 per cent of
the net earnings of the road was to be annually applied to the
payment thereof. The directors were to be not less than fifteen in
number, of whom two were to be appointed by the President of the
United States. It was hoped that the offer would be sufficient to
attract private capital to the undertaking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span> and when it failed in
this, the inducements were increased. The Act of 1864 amended that
of 1862. It reduced the par value of the shares of stock from $1000
to $100, and increased their number from 100,000 to 1,000,000. It
increased the land grant from five to ten alternate sections per
mile, and subordinated the government lien to the rank of a second
mortgage. Only one-half the compensation for services rendered for
the Government was required to be applied to the payment of the bonds
issued by the Government. The directors were to be twenty in number,
of whom five were to be appointed by the Federal President.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<p>It was under these main provisions that the Union Pacific Railroad
was constructed. In their final shape they were intended to provide
for the greater part of the cost of construction, while allowing
the company to supply deficiencies by the issue of its own first
mortgage bonds. Capitalization under these conditions would not have
been excessive; the Government’s investment would have redounded
unmistakably to its own benefit, as well as to that of the country,
and the corporation would have looked forward to a long and
prosperous career. Three things interfered to swell the cost of the
construction of the road, and with that its capitalization: First,
construction was carried on during a time of high prices, swollen not
only by depreciation of the currency, but by artificial conditions
occasioned by the war; second, the normal level of the prices paid
was raised by the speed with which the road was completed; third,
construction was entrusted to a construction company, the famous
Crédit Mobilier.</p>

<p>In its comparison of the prices of the years 1864–9, with those of
1860, the Aldrich Committee arrived, in 1893, at the following result:</p>

<p>The tables show that both currency and gold prices were much higher
in 1866 than before the war, and that both remained high while the
Union Pacific was being built. Wages were also above the normal, and
for similar reasons. During the war the demand for men and goods of
all kinds was great. After 1865 the country turned with tremendous
energy to industry; and the upward swing, which was unchecked
until the panic of 1873, and which was especially directed toward
railroad building, maintained both wages and prices at an unusual
height. Besides this, American rails were at the time in a period of
transition from iron to steel; and much of the work carried through
at such expense had completely to be done over within the next ten
years.</p>

<p>The high prices were made higher by the speed of construction.
The Union Pacific built west from the Missouri River, but at the
same time the Central Pacific was building east from Sacramento,
under similar conditions as to government aid. The two roads were
expected to meet at the western boundary of Nevada; but to encourage
their early completion, the Act of 1862 authorized the road which
first reached the designated point to continue construction, east
or west as the case might be, until junction with the second road
should be made. Since the amount of land granted depended on the
mileage completed, the haste of the companies was feverish. “The
Union Pacific Company,” says Davis,<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> “had its parties of graders
working 200 miles in advance of its completed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span> line in places as far
west as Humboldt Wells.” The Central Pacific had completed 105 miles
east of Sacramento by the autumn of 1867, hauling iron and supplies
over the mountains without waiting for the piercing of its tunnels.
No less than 1038 miles of the Union Pacific, including the difficult
stretch over the Rocky Mountains, were completed by 1869, four years
after construction was commenced. The prize of additional land was
thereby secured, but this land was long unsalable, and the cost of
construction was largely increased.</p>

<p>Finally, large sums were misapplied through a construction company.
The story of the Crédit Mobilier has been so often told that only
brief mention need be made of it here.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> In 1864 T. C. Durant,
vice-president of the Union Pacific, induced one H. M. Hoxie to bid
for a contract to build from Omaha to the one hundredth meridian.
Hoxie was financially irresponsible, and four days later assigned the
contract to a company composed of Durant and other stockholders of
the Union Pacific. Meanwhile Durant had purchased the charter of the
Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency, a corporation which possessed convenient
powers. Later in 1864 the members of Durant’s construction company
were given stock in the Fiscal Agency, now called the Crédit Mobilier
of America, for the amounts they had paid in, and stockholders of the
Union Pacific were allowed to receive Crédit Mobilier stock for the
amounts they had paid in on their Union Pacific shares. Stockholders
of the Union Pacific thus became also stockholders of the Crédit
Mobilier, and in their former capacity were enabled to vote lucrative
contracts to themselves as constructors of the railroad. Durant’s
company assigned its contract to the Crédit Mobilier. Subsequently
it was found more convenient to assign contracts to certain
individuals, who transferred them to seven trustees, who built the
required road with funds furnished by the Crédit Mobilier, and turned
over the profits to that organization, but the practical result
was the same.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> These various devices removed all incentive to
economy on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span> part of the Union Pacific stockholders. Instead
of gaining by cheap construction, they profited by dear; instead
of aiming to reduce the cost in every possible way, they schemed
at making the construction contracts as lucrative as possible to
the persons to whom they were assigned. The advantages to them as
stockholders of the Crédit Mobilier outweighed the disadvantages
to them as stockholders of the Union Pacific. The profits realized
by the Crédit Mobilier are still a subject of dispute. H. K. White
figures them as 27½ per cent, or $16,700,000; Davis says that the
profit was safely over $20,000,000; but whereas White calculates
the percentage of profits to the total cost of construction, Davis
insists that a large part of the capital invested was replaced on the
completion of each section of twenty miles by the proceeds of the
government bonds and railway bonds and stock, and that though from
$50,000,000 to $70,000,000 were expended, in all probability not more
than $10,000,000 were sunk at any one time; in which case a profit
of $20,000,000, spread over four years, represents $5,000,000 per
year, or 50 per cent annually on the capital employed. Finally, the
Union Pacific Railway Commission estimated the actual cash profits
at $23,366,320, and remarked that the obligations incurred by the
railroad company represented a very much larger sum, being measured
by the bonds and stock at their par values.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>

<p>The result of the three factors was a corporation bonded at
an extremely high rate. The cost of road in 1870 was reported
to be $106,245,978, or $102,951 per mile, against which was a
capitalization of $107,907,300, or $104,561 per mile, of which
$32,715 per mile was stock, $26,080 government bonds, and $45,765
first mortgage, land grant, and income bonds. In 1873 the net
earnings were $4,092,032, and the interest on the funded debt,
not including the government interest, was $3,403,660. In 1874
the figures were $5,291,243 and $3,431,720; in other words, the
corporation started with a heavy handicap, which its monopoly of
transcontinental business at first helped to overcome, but which grew
heavier and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span> heavier as the years went on. During the seventies,
to repeat, the Union Pacific enjoyed generally large prosperity.
The volume of stock outstanding remained the same, the bonded
indebtedness but slightly increased, and the ratio of operating
expenses to receipts declined. The first dividend was paid in 1875;
in 1876 and 1877 8 per cent was declared, in 1878 5½ per cent, and in
1879 6 per cent. In 1880, however, a consolidation took place with
the Kansas Pacific and Denver Pacific railroads, and this operation
may well receive somewhat detailed consideration.</p>

<p>The Kansas Pacific, as well as the Union Pacific, was a creation of
the Acts of 1862 and 1864, which required it to be constructed from
Kansas City westwardly to form a junction with the Union Pacific
at a point on the one hundredth meridian. Later, an Act of July 3,
1866, authorized it to change its route, and to connect with the
Union Pacific at a point not more than fifty miles westwardly from
the meridian of Denver in Colorado.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> Like the Union Pacific the
Kansas Pacific was built by means of construction contracts, which
resulted in a total capitalization on its 638 miles of line of
$9,437,950 in stock and $22,651,000 in bonds, or $14,793 and $33,455
respectively per mile,—high figures in view of the comparatively
level character of the country traversed.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> The road was not a
paying one. It was poorly built and poorly managed, and running
parallel with the Union Pacific, it had to meet competition of a
very bitter kind. The report of Mr. Calhoun, expert accountant for
the United States Pacific Railway Commission of 1887, showed that
the total receipts of the road from 1867 to 1879 had aggregated
$9,220,218, while the bond and interest account, exclusive of United
States interest, had amounted to $15,745,287; leaving a deficit of
$6,525,069, or, including the United States accrued interest, of
$11,330,772.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> That is, the Kansas Pacific was in a state of
chronic insolvency. In 1874 it was placed in the hands of receivers,
and the following year, by an arrangement with its creditors, it
funded a considerable amount of overdue interest.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
In 1878 a number of securityholders of the Kansas Pacific got
together in an attempt to reorganize that property, to take it out
of receivers’ hands, and to “unite in interest the Kansas Pacific
and Union Pacific Railway Companies.” Twelve large securityholders
consented to contribute to a common pool or fund holdings of
securities taken at a fixed valuation, their interests in the pool to
be proportional to the amounts of said securities and stock taken at
the value referred to.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> For the securities deposited they were
to receive stock at a reduced rate: thus for eight shares of old
stock they were to receive one share of new; for $2000 unsubordinated
income bonds they were to get ten shares, and for $10,000
subordinated income bonds thirty shares of new stock.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> The final
result would have been to replace securities with a par value of
$17,330,350 by stock with a par of $4,855,300, and greatly to lighten
the burdens upon the road; though it must be remembered that the
$17,330,350 were less than half of the total volume of securities
outstanding, that the payment of interest on much of these had been
optional only, and that no provision was made for the floating debt.</p>

<p>The scheme fell through, according to Mr. Gould, who was a party to
the agreement, because securityholders outside of the pool refused
to consent to so drastic a reduction of their holdings; and at his
suggestion a consolidated mortgage was substituted for the issues of
stock. This mortgage was for forty years at 6 per cent. The total
issue was to be for $30,000,000, of which $24,000,000 were to be
issued at once for the retirement of earlier bond issues and for
payment of arrears of interest.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> Like the previous proposition
the scheme contemplated a scaling in the principal of the junior
securities, and the same rates of commutation were retained; but
in this case the old Kansas Pacific stock was withdrawn from the
operation of the plan, and certain reservations were made for other
purposes, so that an actual increase in indebtedness was finally to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
result, and even the interest charges were certain to increase.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a>
For the time being, however, by force of the reduction of interest
on the funding mortgage in January, 1879, from 10 to 7 per cent, and
by the disallowance of some claims for overdue interest, relief was
obtained, while the consolidated mortgage was duly issued.</p>

<p>The Kansas Pacific ran west to Denver. Between Denver and Cheyenne
the Denver Pacific, 106 miles long, served as a connecting link
between the larger systems. The Denver Pacific stock was held by the
Kansas Pacific, and 29,979 shares of it were pledged in 1877 as part
security for an issue of 10 per cent funding mortgage bonds.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a>
The total earnings of the Denver Pacific from 1870 to 1879 had been
$3,122,141; the expenses had been $1,709,477, and the net earnings
from operation $1,412,664, or an average per annum of $141,266; while
for the first eight years of that time the annual interest charge had
been about $185,000. The only value of the Denver Pacific stock lay
in the control which it secured over a connecting link between Denver
and Cheyenne.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></p>

<p>Under the conditions of competition existing between the Union
Pacific, Kansas Pacific, and Denver Pacific, some sort of agreement
or consolidation was both desirable and likely. The Kansas Pacific
was entirely dependent on its competitor for access to western
business, and this was soon perceived to be equivalent to continuous
bankruptcy. Extension to Ogden would have removed the dependence;
but this, while to be dreaded by the Union Pacific, was beyond the
power of the Kansas Pacific for financial reasons, and no capitalist
or group of capitalists before 1878 or 1879 seemed interested in
the undertaking. On the other hand, rates were low, and the very
success of its exclusive policy forced the Union Pacific to meet the
competition of a road which, with no interest charges to pay, was
able to cut all rates to the very verge of the cost of operation.</p>

<p>As early as 1875 there was talk of an agreement whereby the Kansas
Pacific was to give up its claims for a pro rate on its Pacific
business in return for a monopoly of the local business of Colorado,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
and in connection with the deal was to acquire the Colorado Central
Railroad on issue of $10,000,000 Kansas Pacific stock to parties
designated by the Union Pacific Company; but this was never carried
out. In 1878, when Gould began to be interested in the property,
a union by means of stock control seemed feasible. Gould’s first
purchases were of bonds, and it was as a bondholder that he entered
the pool of 1878; but with the purchase of the holdings of the “St.
Louis parties,” he and his friends obtained control of a majority
of Kansas Pacific stock. In fact one of the provisions of the pool
was that if on the first day of June, 1878, it should be found that
Messrs. Gould, Dillon, and Ames, all large stockholders in the
Union Pacific, had not a majority interest in said pool, then they
should have an option on such an amount of other interest ratably
and for cash as on the basis of the schedule should give them such
an interest; and though this majority did not necessarily involve
a majority of stock, the operations of the pool aided Gould in the
acquisition of control. The union between the Union Pacific and the
Kansas Pacific thus secured was, however, of the frailest kind; for
Mr. Gould at no time had the permanent interest of either road at
heart, and looked for his personal profit rather in their struggles
than in agreement between them. For this reason, as he bought Kansas
Pacific, Gould sold Union Pacific stock, reducing his holdings from
about 200,000 to about 27,000 shares.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> In 1879 the situation
of the two roads was thus much the same as before, and the harmony
apparent was of the most superficial kind. One change, however, had
taken place to the serious disadvantage of the Union Pacific; for
the Kansas Pacific, although still badly built and dependent upon
its rival for an adjustment of rates sufficiently favorable to let
it into the western business, had now interested in it a group of
capitalists quite capable of financing an extension to Ogden, and
even of securing connections from Kansas City to the East.</p>

<p>In 1879, doubtless relying upon the strength of Kansas Pacific’s new
backing, Gould proposed to the Union Pacific a consolidation of the
Union, Kansas, and Denver Pacific roads, in which the shares of each
were to figure equally at par. The terms were absurd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span> by every test
of productive capacity which could have been applied. The relative
earning power and annual interest per mile of the three roads at this
time were given by a government accountant as follows:</p>

<p class="in0">The Union Pacific had reported an annual surplus, the other two roads
an annual deficit; the Union Pacific had not defaulted, the Kansas
and Denver Pacific had done little else; the highest mark which the
Kansas Pacific stock had touched in January, 1879, had been 13, that
of the Union Pacific had been 68½. But the question, as Gould well
knew, was not one of productive but one of destructive capacity,
and the means of coercion which he employed was a demonstration of
the ease with which the Kansas Pacific could be made formidable
as a competing line. In November, 1879, he purchased the Missouri
Pacific from Kansas City to St. Louis; about the same time he bought
two minor roads between the Kansas Pacific and the Union Pacific in
Kansas, and announced his intention of extending the Kansas Pacific
to Salt Lake City, there to connect with the Central Pacific and to
form a third transcontinental route. The story is clearly told in
the report of the United States Pacific Railway Commission.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a>
The result was the consent of the Union Pacific directors to the
terms imposed, and the execution of an agreement dated January 14,
1880, whereby the Union and the Kansas Pacific, with all their
respective assets and liabilities, were put together at par of their
respective capitals,—$36,762,300 and $10,000,000,—to which was
added the capital of the Denver Pacific, $4,000,000, forming a new
company called the Union Pacific Railway Company, with a capital of
$50,762,300, and a bonded indebtedness of $92,984,624.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> This
corporation was larger in every way than the old Union Pacific
Railroad, except in one particular—earnings above fixed charges. It
had 1821 miles of line instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span> 1042; $22,455,134 gross earnings
instead of $13,201,077; $10,545,119 operating expenses instead of
$5,475,503; and yet, since the consolidation was a union of some
strength with a vast deal of weakness, there were few who profited by
it save the holders of Kansas Pacific or Denver Pacific stocks. Those
lucky and skilful individuals saw the quotations of Kansas Pacific
common rise from a high level of 13 in January, 1879, to one of 59 in
June, and of 92½ in December; and the stock which had been a football
in the market thus become of such value that in 1887 Gould was able
to lay before a committee of Congress, in justification of the terms
described, a table which showed for 1880 market prices of Kansas and
Union Pacific stock which were approximately the same.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>It was to Gould, as chief owner of Kansas Pacific and holder of
practically all of the Denver Pacific stock outstanding, that the
lion’s share of the profits went; but Mr. Gould was not satisfied
with a harvest on these stocks alone. In the course of his operations
he had become possessed of certain branch and minor roads in whole
or in part. Thus he held $945,887 in bonds of a company known as the
St. Joseph &amp; Western Railroad Company, and 5013 shares of its stock;
$634,000 in bonds of the St. Joseph Bridge Company; and $59,000 in
St. Joseph &amp; Denver Pacific Railroad receivers’ certificates; while
to convince the Union Pacific directors of the wisdom of accepting
his plan of consolidation he had acquired the Missouri Pacific, the
Kansas Central, and the Central Branch Union Pacific railroads.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a>
The earning capacity of none of these lines was large, that of the
Missouri Pacific being the greatest. The St. Joseph &amp; Western had
been sold in foreclosure in 1875, and had continued to be managed
thereafter by a receiver. What value it had was due<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span> to the fact
that, as extended to Grand Island, it gave to the Union Pacific an
outlet to the East other than the one at Omaha. The value of the
Bridge Company bonds and of the receivers’ certificates was dependent
upon this same property. The Kansas Central was a narrow-gauge road
and had been sold under foreclosure in April, 1879. The Central
Branch Union Pacific had been designed to join with the Kansas
Pacific, but had been left without western connection when this
latter road had failed to meet the Union Pacific at the hundredth
meridian. At the time of the consolidation, according to the United
States Pacific Railway Commission, “the coupons for six years were
in default, and were retained uncancelled as security for the income
mortgage. The company had never earned sufficient to pay its own
coupons, without taking into account the accruing interest to the
United States in any form.”<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> The Missouri Pacific was more
prosperous, but need not here concern us. Mr. Gould had paid various
prices for the above, ranging from $40 for the St. Joseph &amp; Denver
bonds to $238 for the stock of the Central Branch Union Pacific.
In the case of each road he turned over his purchase to the Union
Pacific for the same or a greater price.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> Thus for the St. Joseph
&amp; Western bonds, for which he had paid 40, he received par in Union
Pacific stock selling as high as 94 in January, 1880; for $634,000
bonds and 4000 shares of stock of the St. Joseph Bridge Company,
costing $480,440, he received 6340 shares of Union Pacific stock; for
$479,000 in bonds and 2521 shares of stock of the Kansas Central, he
received 4790 shares of Union Pacific; and for 7616 shares of Central
Branch Union Pacific, costing $1,826,500, he received $913,500 in
Union Pacific six per cent bonds and $913,500 in Kansas Pacific
six per cent bonds.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> The result was the issue of considerable
amounts of stock of the consolidated and bonds of the consolidating
companies, without equivalent value received.</p>

<p>The Union Pacific Railway Company, therefore, began its career in
1880 in worse shape than the Union Pacific Railroad Company, which
had preceded it, for it suffered not only from an initial watering of
stocks and bonds, but from a watering of assets which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span> followed.
Including the government subsidy and accrued interest thereon, the
total bonds and stocks of the company in 1880 were $179,058,902,
or $98,329 per mile, of which $27,876 were stock, $45,372 mortgage
bonds, and $25,081 government subsidy and interest. The figures per
mile were slightly lower than in 1870, and yet the water in the
capitalization was more abundant, for the average value of the assets
had declined still more. A dividend-paying road had been combined
with non-dividend payers, with the result of large profits to the
promoters of the consolidations, but of serious harm to the solvent
party.</p>

<p>Between 1880 and 1883 a number of branches were constructed, to
provide funds for which the capital stock of the Railway Company
was increased $10,000,000. Of these the Denver &amp; South Park was
constructed in the years 1881 to 1883, and was the last of Mr.
Gould’s gifts to the parent line. This road was handled by several
construction companies, in the last of which Gould took a quarter
interest, receiving stock of the Denver &amp; South Park Railroad Company
as a dividend on his investment.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> In November, 1880, acting in
behalf of the Union Pacific Railway Company, he bought the stock
of the Denver road at par for cash, benefiting in his capacity as
quarter owner by his action as representative and stockholder of the
Union Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> In relation to the road Mr. Charles F. Adams,
Jr., subsequently said: “The chief source of revenue ... was in
carrying men and material into Colorado to dig holes in the ground
called mines, and until it was discovered that there was nothing
in those mines the business was immense.”<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> A more important
and genuinely beneficial project was the organization in 1881 of
the Oregon Short Line Railway Company to construct and operate a
railway from Granger on the Union Pacific to and into the state of
Oregon, a distance of 610 miles, with the intention of securing
the Washington and Oregon business. The Northern Pacific was in
financial difficulties at the time, and it was not expected that it
could anticipate the new road; but even though this expectation was
disappointed, and the Oregon Short Line was second in reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
disputed territory, its value was great and steadily grew.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> The
road was built by the construction department of the Union Pacific,
and was financed by the organization of a subsidiary corporation
which issued stock and bonds to an amount of $25,000 per mile,
one-half of the stock being reserved in the Union Pacific treasury
for the purpose of control, and the Union Pacific guaranteeing
the payment of interest on the bonds. This branch at least was
not unloaded on the main line by interested parties, and forms an
essential part of the system to-day. Other branches were bought or
constructed at the time, but do not require detailed mention.</p>

<p>Gould for the time had obtained from the Union Pacific all that he
thought possible, and quietly unloaded his stock, while keeping
up the payment of dividends. By 1883 he was substantially clear,
but he had left his mark; the consolidation of 1880, with the
forced purchase of worthless branches, aided as it was by the high
capitalization caused by extravagant original construction, and
accompanied by a steadily increasing intensity of competition between
transcontinental lines, had diminished the surplus to a dangerous
extent. At the same time the prosperity of the country as a whole was
declining; the wheat crop of 1881 was only three-quarters as large
as the crop of 1880, and the corn crop was the smallest since 1874;
though the decline was not so marked in Kansas and the far West as in
the states east and south of Omaha and Kansas. By 1882, says Noyes,
all the markets were moving downward, and after the reaction of that
year, the volume of internal trade decreased continuously until after
the panic of 1884.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p>The evidence of distress on the part of the Union Pacific was the
mounting up of the floating debt. In November, 1882, President
Dillon stated that it then amounted to $3,400,000, and that a loan
of $5,000,000 was to be negotiated to take care of it.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> The
annual report at the end of the year stated the net debt to be only
$842,743, but included in the assets used to offset the gross debt
$2,768,437 in fuel and material on hand, and $927,648 in balances
due from auxiliary roads; so that early the following year it was
again a subject of discussion, and the stockholders recommended to
the directors the issue of collateral bonds in order to wipe it
out. Pursuant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span> to the recommendation the directors executed to the
New England Trust Company of Boston an indenture under which it
proposed to issue trust bonds to an amount equal to 90 per cent of
the securities deposited. By 1884 the gross floating debt amounted,
nevertheless, to $11,306,595, as against $9,852,325 gross in 1882,
and the quick assets, exclusive of fuel and material, counted up
to $8,068,898, instead of to $6,241,145. The chief increase in
liabilities, as always, had taken place in bills payable, meaning
that the road had been giving its notes for the payment of current
indebtedness, with the consequent necessity of paying a high rate of
interest, and of making frequent renewals. Meanwhile dividends had
been stopped and salaries cut down.</p>

<p>At this juncture Mr. Sidney Dillon resigned the presidency, and Mr.
Charles Francis Adams, Jr., was elected his successor. Mr. Dillon was
well along in years, was said to be in poor health, and doubtless
missed the support which Mr. Gould had been accustomed to render
him. Mr. Adams was a younger man, only forty-nine years of age as
against the sixty-nine of Mr. Dillon. He had been a member of the
Massachusetts Railway Commission from 1869 to 1879, had served as
government director of the Union Pacific in 1878, and now brought
to his position as president an inexhaustible fund of energy, large
resourcefulness, and more important still, a nice sense of his
obligations towards the bondholders and shareholders of his road.
Under his régime the economies earlier initiated were continued and
extended; employees were discharged until, by June 28, 1884, the
company had only about 10,000 men in its employ instead of the 20,000
who had been on the rolls at one time; and rolling mills, etc., were
closed wherever the company found it cheaper to purchase rails and
equipment at current prices. This, with the cessation of dividends,
left a considerable surplus revenue applicable to the payment of
the floating debt. In addition, bonds and stock from the company’s
treasury were sold between January 1, 1884, and January 1, 1887, for
which $6,550,000 were obtained; and the aggregate of resources made
available was $16,200,000, of which $8,251,368 were applied to the
floating debt, $6,708,632 to betterment of the road and branch-line
construction, and $1,240,000 to increase of equipment.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> In
addition the proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span> from land sales were used to the same general
end. In August, to reassure investors, President Adams stated that no
part of the floating debt was pressing, and in November he repeated
the statement; the truth of which was made evident by the payment of
the last bit of net unfunded indebtedness on August 22, two years
later. The result was highly creditable, although the continued
cessation of dividends provoked some protest.</p>

<p>Much could be done at this time by able and energetic management;
there was, however, much that could not be done; and it is to this
that we must attribute Mr. Adams’s failure to put the road in a
permanently stable position. For first, the competition which the
Union Pacific was obliged to meet was constantly increasing in
severity. In 1881 the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe was extended to
a junction with the Southern Pacific at Deming; in 1883, in the
language of the annual report, “Not only was the Rio Grande completed
to Ogden, making, in connection with the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe
and the Burlington &amp; Missouri extension of the Chicago, Burlington &amp;
Quincy, a direct competing route with the Union Pacific from Chicago
and all eastern points to a common western terminus, but the Northern
Pacific also was connected through, making a third transcontinental
route.”<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> In 1887 the Atchison built 450 miles of line and the
Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific was scarcely behind, so that Kansas
and Nebraska were covered with a network of lines, which transformed
the natural local traffic of the Union Pacific into competitive
business of the most uncertain kind. At the same time the profitable
high grade business was giving way to a larger volume of mineral
traffic, and the average length of haul was increasing, all of which
resulted in a decrease of about 45 per cent in the average receipts
per ton mile between 1881 and 1890, a slow increase in gross earnings
which bore little relation to the greatly increased volume of
business done, and a fluctuating progress of net earnings, which were
actually over $3,000,000 less in 1889 than they had been eight years
before.</p>

<p>And second, during this time the fixed charges of the Union Pacific
did not materially decrease. They were $7,626,626 when Mr. Adams
assumed the presidency, and $7,309,142 five years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span> later; and the
necessity for further decrease was shown by the fact that the total
net income of the road was $11,402,199 in 1884, $10,339,402 in 1889,
and $9,561,673 in 1890. What Mr. Adams could do he did, and the
funded debt under his régime decreased from $90,760,582 in 1884 to
$82,090,585 in 1889, and to $73,968,885 in 1890; the company steadily
buying up its own indebtedness: but the conditions which he had to
face were too exacting, and the saving made here was offset in other
ways.</p>

<p>To save itself the Union Pacific was driven to a rapid extension of
its branch mileage, which Mr. Adams held to be the only means by
which fixed charges could be paid.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> Between 1884 and 1890 3132.45
miles were built or acquired, all under separate organizations,
but with their accounts and management under the supervision and
control of the officers of the parent line; and the amount invested
in branch-line securities was raised from about $28,000,000 in 1881
to $41,879,724 in 1892. These roads reported annual deficits, which
were either paid out of earnings or carried as floating debt. The
report of the Government Directors in 1891 declared that $15,000,000
out of $21,400,000 of floating debt were the result of expenditures
and advances in the construction of branch and tributary lines and
the purchase of stock in such lines for the purpose of control.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a>
But speaking in 1887, Mr. Adams declared the branches to be worth
$5,000,000 a year to the main line, entirely apart from anything
which appeared in the accounts of the branches themselves, and in a
letter to the Government Directors in 1884 he said: “The branches
and auxiliary lines of the Union Pacific should be considered the
only real security the Government has for the repayment of its
indebtedness.... Were it not for these branches the Union Pacific
would be confined to such small local traffic as it could pick up at
points directly upon its main line; and to its share of the through
transcontinental business which has recently been subdivided by
four through the construction of competing routes.”<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> The most
important of the branches remained the Oregon Short Line, with the
connecting line of the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span> Company, of which
the Union Pacific became finally possessed in 1889. This last road
had been long considered the natural outlet of the Northern Pacific
to the Pacific coast, but had been leased by the Union Pacific in
1887 through the Oregon Short Line with a guarantee of 6 per cent
dividends upon its stock as well as interest upon its bonds for
999 years. In 1889 negotiations with the Northern Pacific resulted
finally in the sale of the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation stock held
by Mr. Villard and his friends. Pending the issue of a collateral
trust mortgage the stock was deposited with a trust company, a note
was given for the amount, and the sum was carried as floating debt.
Whatever the value of the property to the Northern Pacific, it proved
of great worth to the Union Pacific, providing it with an independent
outlet to the coast, and giving it a haul on its main line of over
800 miles on all interchanged traffic. The method of payment proved a
dangerous one, however, in that it so largely swelled the volume of
the Union Pacific’s quick liabilities.</p>

<p>In 1891 Mr. Gould again began buying Union Pacific stock. Mr. Adams
therefore resigned late in the year, and Mr. Dillon was elected to
his position. The time was not ripe for expansion of any kind, and
Mr. Gould’s death the following year put an effectual check on any
schemes which he might have entertained. The immediate problem was
the floating debt, swollen to unwieldy proportions by the acquisition
of branch lines, and in particular by the purchase of the Oregon
Railway &amp; Navigation Company. During 1890 a block of collateral bonds
was issued and sold, but the remainder of the proposed issue was
kept back in the hope of a better price. While waiting, Mr. Gould
devised a scheme for the postponement of the payment of these and of
other quick liabilities by the issue of three-year collateral notes,
to be underwritten by a syndicate composed of himself and of other
gentlemen interested in the property. These notes were to bear 6 per
cent, and were to be issued at 92½ to such holders of the floating
debt as would accept them, the syndicate taking care of the balance.
The authorized amount was to be $24,000,000, of which $5,500,000
were to be issued at once. The plan was declared operative on
September 28, 1891. If, now, the Union Pacific had been a moderately
capitalized corporation, with fixed charges normally well below its
earning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span> capacity, and if, in 1894, when the notes were to mature,
the market conditions had been more favorable than in 1891, it is
probable that this scheme, temporary as it was, would have met
the needs of the situation. Since neither of these contingencies
occurred the insufficiency of the plan may be said to be in part
the misfortune of the Union Pacific and in part its fault. It was a
particular misfortune that the severest panic since 1873 should occur
when the road was staggering under a load which it could scarcely
bear; but it was altogether a fault that the railroad should have
been so burdened as to be able to lay by no reserve in good times for
the hard times which were bound to come.</p>

<p>In 1892, therefore, the Union Pacific was in a difficult position.
Its capitalization was high; its earnings had shown scarcely any
increase for five years; its surplus had not been sufficient to
prevent the accumulation of a large floating debt; it had to prepare
to raise a large sum of money in two years for the payment of its
short time notes; and, in addition, there was ahead a fact of
which little has been said so far,—the maturing of the government
indebtedness.</p>

<p>Briefly sketched, the history of this indebtedness was as follows:
The Acts of 1862 and 1864 had provided for the issue of government
bonds for stated amounts per mile on the subsidized portions of
the system in aid of construction, which bonds were to mature
thirty years from date of issue, and to have a lien on the property
covered second only to the first mortgage of the company. The rate
of interest was 6 per cent, payable to the bondholders by the
Government; and in 1875 the Supreme Court decided that the company
was not obliged to repay to the Government the accruing interest
before the maturity of the bonds.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> This ruling was regarded as a
victory for the company, but meant the steady piling up of arrears
of interest, lessened only by the retention by the Government of
one-half the amounts due for government transportation, and, under
the Thurman Act, of such additional sum not in excess of $850,000 as,
added to the whole compensation for government services and to the 5
per cent of net earnings set aside under the Act of 1862, should make
the annual contribution equal to 25 per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span> cent of the net earnings of
the company, unless the remaining 75 per cent should be insufficient
to pay the interest on the first mortgage bonds; in which case the
Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to remit a portion of the
25 per cent of net earnings required.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> The Thurman Act did not
fulfil expectations. The Supreme Court in 1891 held that expenditures
for new construction and new equipment could not be deducted from
gross earnings in ascertaining net earnings,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> but the road met
hard times and the maximum limit of the contributions to the sinking
fund was not attained, and in investing the fund in government bonds
the Secretary of the Treasury was compelled to pay high premiums,
thus reducing the net interest; so that from the beginning to 1892
the question of indebtedness to the Government occasioned constant
dispute and litigation, introduced uncertainty into the affairs of
the railroad, and caused hard feelings between it and the Government.
In 1892 the necessity for some settlement was near at hand. The
principal of the government debt matured as follows:</p>

<p>Deducting from this amount the sums paid to the Government and
the company’s credits for mail and carriage, and adding arrears
of interest, the sum due the Government at the last of 1893 was
approximately $52,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> It was obviously highly difficult
for the company to pay this sum in 1892 or 1898 or any other time,
and for some years both the company and the Government had been
earnestly discussing schemes for refunding, and the advantages and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
disadvantages of the ownership and operation of the road by the
United States. Thus in 1892 an overwhelming obligation was hanging
over the Union Pacific; and did not crush it only because the
inability of the road to pay was so evident, and the inadvisability
of government ownership was so strongly believed in, that every one
felt that the necessary concessions would be made.</p>

<p>In 1893 the sinking-fund 8 per cent bonds matured to the amount
of $5,176,000, and were partially extended and partially paid off
through the medium of an underwriting syndicate; but this was the
last attempt to meet indebtedness coming due. During the year both
gross and net earnings fell off enormously, owing to the general
depression of business, and particularly to the stagnation upon the
Pacific coast. Freight rates were said to be in a state of chaos;
and the Union Pacific served notice that it would withdraw from the
Western Passenger Association on October 10. As the year wore on the
continued decrease in earnings made the situation desperate. “The
company for the year ending December 31, 1892,” said Mr. John F.
Dillon, counsel for the Union Pacific, in November, “had a surplus of
$2,000,000. In the month of September (1893) there was a loss of net
revenue of $1,500,000 as compared with the preceding year, and from
January 1 to August 31 there has been a falling off in net revenue
of over $2,500,000. The company is indebted for labor and materials
on October 1 to the amount of $1,500,000; and its sinking-fund and
interest charges for September would be more than $1,000,000; for
October $750,000, for November $850,000, for December $1,000,000, and
for January $1,000,000. There will be a deficit for the year 1893 of
at least $3,000,000 and the company is without money or means to meet
these obligations....”<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></p>

<p>Under these conditions a receivership was the only device which could
prevent the dismemberment of the system and protect the interests
of all the creditors; and accordingly, on application of parties
friendly to the company, Messrs. S. H. Clark (president of the Union
Pacific), O. W. Mink (comptroller), and E. E. Anderson (government
director), were appointed in October;<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> Mr. Clark taking charge
of the operation of the road, and Messrs. Mink<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span> and Anderson of the
financial and legal business.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> One month later, on application
of the Attorney-General, Messrs. John W. Doane and Frederick R.
Coudert were appointed additional receivers to safeguard the
government interests and to assist the other receivers in the general
administration of the property.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> These gentlemen remained in
office until the reorganization was complete, though various portions
of the system passed from their jurisdiction from time to time.</p>

<p>The appointment of receivers closed a long struggle to maintain the
solvency of the road. A reorganization was now in order, and in this
it was to be possible to do what Mr. Adams had not been able to
do,—namely, to rearrange the capitalization of the road, thereby
permanently lessening the fixed charges and securing a reserve of
earning capacity sufficient to avoid bankruptcy when receipts for any
cause should show a considerable decrease. This was the fundamental
condition of future prosperity. Besides, the debt to the Government
had to be settled, cash raised to pay the floating debt, including
the three-year notes of 1891, and the system held together so that
its earning capacity should not be destroyed.</p>

<p>As might be expected, it was the debt to the Government which was
most publicly and persistently discussed. There seemed to be four
ways in which this might be handled:</p>

<p>First, the Government might have cancelled the obligation and have
remained satisfied with the enormous economies which it had secured
in the transportation of mails and other government business. In the
seven years between 1867 and 1873 alone the Quartermaster-General
estimated that the Union Pacific had saved the Government $6,507,283
in the cost of moving troops and supplies,<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> and there was no
doubt that by 1896 the investment of the Government, with interest,
had been many times regained. But it was pointed out not only that
the Union Pacific deserved little consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span> in that its
earnings had been wrongfully diverted from the payments demanded by
the Thurman Act by the manipulations of Gould and others, but that
the precedent of renouncing a just claim would be an extremely bad
one for the Government to set.</p>

<p>Second, the Government might have exacted larger payments to the
sinking fund, and have extended the debt at an unchanged rate of
interest until it should be automatically discharged. This was the
proposal of Mr. Hampton, Commissioner of Railroads, who suggested
the amendment of the Thurman Act as follows: it should embrace all
the United States bond-aided Pacific railroads; it should compel the
contribution of 50 per cent of net earnings to a sinking fund instead
of 25 per cent, and should extend the indebtedness to the Government
until discharged as provided. If any company should abandon a portion
of a subsidized line or divert its business from a subsidized to an
unsubsidized line, that company should transfer the conditions which
were attached to the former to the latter, in order to protect the
interests of the United States Government.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> The weak points in
this scheme were many. Among them may be pointed out the fact that
contributions to the sinking fund under the Thurman Act had been
necessarily invested in government bonds, which, in view of the
premium at which they were necessarily purchased, yielded a very
small return. To double the contributions would have been to double
the amount of the railroad’s funds sunk in but slightly remunerative
investments; and the Government did not seem inclined to permit the
company to adopt the only practicable alternative, that of investing
its sinking fund in its own securities. Also, Mr. Hampton’s amendment
would have continued to an enhanced degree the constant suspicious
supervision of the company by the Government which had been, perhaps,
the chief evil result of the Thurman Act.</p>

<p>Third, the Government might have consented to a refunding of the
indebtedness to it at a lower rate of interest. This was most
urgently pressed by representatives of the road. Mr. A. A. H.
Boissevain, representing the Dutch bondholders, proposed to redeem
the first mortgage by the securities in the sinking fund so far as
possible, and to renew the rest at a lower rate of interest;—after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
which the Government was to be given a 100-year 2 per cent bond
for the principal and interest of its claim.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> Attorney-General
Olney similarly suggested a renewal of the first mortgage bonds at a
rate of not over 5 per cent, and an exchange of 100-year 2 per cent
bonds for the government claim; though he differed somewhat from
Mr. Boissevain as to the lien which these bonds should have.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a>
Congress and the Government Directors in 1894 were inclined to insist
on harder terms. The latter, in their annual report, proposed that
the first mortgage bonds be paid off in cash, and that a 100-year 3
per cent instead of a 2 per cent bond be given to the Government,
with elaborate provision for a sinking fund; and the former had
before it in the Reilly Bill a very similar suggestion.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> As a
counter-proposition the railway company offered to pay off the first
mortgage bonds in cash if the Government would take a 50-year 2 per
cent instead of a 3 per cent bond for its claim. “The petitioners
further represent,” it said, “that it will be utterly impossible to
obtain the very large sums referred to from the stockholders unless
it be possible to offer to them in satisfaction of their assessments
reasonable security for the moneys so advanced. At a meeting recently
held, at which were present representatives of a large amount of the
stock of the said company, the conclusion was reached that if the
debt to the Government could be funded substantially on the terms of
the Reilly Bill, but at a rate of interest of 2 per cent per annum
instead of 3 per cent, the said stockholders would endeavor to raise
the funds needed for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the
Reilly Bill.”<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> Finally, Mr. Pierce, on behalf of the Fitzgerald
Reorganization Committee, proposed that the Government either take
4 per cent bonds for the principal of its debt, and preferred stock
for the interest, carrying into the settlement with the Government
the scheme which was found best adapted to the satisfaction of other
creditors; or that it take a 3 per cent first mortgage bond for its
principal, and a second mortgage non-interest-bearing bond for its
interest; or that it accept a lump sum of money equal to the value of
its lien, which he informally estimated as 50 per cent of the total<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
amount due.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> The plan of refunding was the most obvious as well
as the most practicable of all suggestions. It had, however, the
disadvantage from the point of view of the Government of surrendering
some part of the government claim, and from that of the company of
continuing the relations of the Government with the road.</p>

<p>Fourth and last, the Government might have demanded payment in cash.
The sum which the company would have had to obtain was extremely
large, but the accumulated sinking fund reduced it considerably,
and many thought that the balance could be raised. In March, 1896,
before a Senate committee, Mr. John Rooney, for the first mortgage
bondholders, proposed that the Government, through a commission,
should buy in the Union Pacific at foreclosure sale, should issue a
new general mortgage at a lower rate of interest than the existing
prior liens, and should pay off both the first and the government
mortgage with the proceeds;—the road to be turned over to the
subscribers.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> This suggestion took place among many others
which were in the nature of a compromise. Thus the reorganization
committee, in 1895, offered to pay the principal of the government
debt provided that the interest were cancelled;<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> and Receiver
Anderson proposed in 1896 that the company pay the principal of the
debt by adding funds raised by it to the amount of the sinking fund,
and settle the arrears of interest with a 50-year 2 per cent bond.
Full payment in cash was, of course, what the Government desired,
and everything short of that it hesitated to accept; but equally, of
course, full payment was what the bondholders of the road were most
unwilling to concede; and hearing after hearing took place before
committees of the Senate and of the House without definite result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the general reorganization of the company was going on.
In November, 1893, the various interests and factions of the road
held a conference in New York, which resulted in the choice of a
reorganization committee as follows: Senator Brice, chairman; Mr.
A. H. Boissevain, for the foreign holders; General Louis Fitzgerald,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
president of the Mercantile Trust Company, for the Gould interests;
Mr. Carr, for the estate of F. L. Ames; General Dodge, for the
Denver and Gulf roads’ interests; and Colonel H. L. Higginson,
for the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation interests.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> Subsequently
Mr. J. P. Morgan accepted a place.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> This committee was the
only comprehensive one appointed until 1895; but numerous other
committees sprang up to represent special interests of one kind or
another, appearing frequently as interest on new classes of bonds
was defaulted, and having, with the main reorganization committee,
to deal specifically with the payment of the floating debt and the
reduction of fixed charges. Upon the ability of the committees to
agree depended the retention of the Union Pacific in something like
its existing shape.</p>

<p>Aside from the question of the government debt there seemed to be a
general agreement as to what was needed to be done. Every suggestion
contemplated the payment of the first mortgage in full and the
reduction of the interest upon the junior securities; most included
with this an assessment on the stock, and one at least proposed the
cancellation of the guarantee on the stock of the Oregon Railway &amp;
Navigation Company.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> The principles were obvious. A large sum of
money had to be raised with which to pay the floating debt and to
meet possible demands by the Government. This had to come from the
junior securities or from the stock, and preferably from the stock,
which represented ownership in the enterprise. On the other hand,
reductions in fixed charges had to come from the junior securities
as the youngest interests which had a mortgage lien. Differences
of opinion occurred upon the details. Should there or should there
not be a foreclosure? How large an assessment was required? How
great must the reduction in interest charges be, and should bonds
or stock or both be given to the junior securities in exchange for
their holdings? Should the system as it stood be preserved, or should
certain parts of it be let go?</p>

<p>In June, 1894, Mr. Boissevain stated that the reorganization
committee thought that they should be in a position to formulate
a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span> complete plan of reorganization speedily after the terms of
the adjustment of the debt to the United States had been approved
by Congress. “It is our opinion that the fixed charges of the
reorganized company ... should not exceed $8,500,000 per annum.
Certain classes of existing bonds secured by mortgage on portions of
the system cannot be and should not be disturbed, as they are amply
secured by property earning the interest which is payable thereon.
Other bonds, however, must be converted in whole or in part into
securities not imposing a fixed charge upon the reorganized company.
While the reorganization committee has not approved of any definite
plan, we believe that holders of bonds which must be disturbed and
creditors and stockholders interested in the system can be provided
for upon an equitable basis by the creation of the following
securities:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) An issue of general mortgage bonds (at 4 per cent), secured
by a general mortgage covering the entire system, subject to such
mortgages as cannot be disturbed, and to the lien of the United
States upon the main line and Kansas Pacific division for the
adjusted debt.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) An issue of 5 per cent preferred stock.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) An issue of common stock.</p>

<p>The plan of reorganization would require provision to be made to
take up the trust notes secured by valuable collaterals. The funds
required for this purpose and for the other cash requirements of the
reorganization would be met in part by a reasonable assessment upon
the stockholders, and in part by the sale of new securities.”<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></p>

<p>A not dissimilar suggestion was made by the Government Directors in
1894. They proposed to ascertain the minimum net earning power of
the railroad or railroads to be reorganized, and to issue a blanket
mortgage of 3 per cent 100-year bonds to an amount such that the
accruing interest would not exceed the net earning power. By sale
of a portion of these bonds, together with a $10 assessment on the
stock, and the use of the moneys and securities in the sinking fund,
they would have paid off the prior liens, and then, after exchanging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the new 3 per cent bonds for the government claim, they would have
used the balance to retire the junior securities, adding preferred
stock, so much as necessary, to compensate for the difference in
yield between the old securities and the new ones received. The
amount of securities required they estimated at $150,000,000 3 per
cent bonds, $20,000,000 preferred stock, and $61,000,000 common
stock; the latter exchanging for old common stock at par.</p>

<p>Both of these plans contained excellent features, chief among which
were their provisions for the raising of cash and their use of
preferred stock. The cash which Mr. Boissevain proposed to raise was
to meet the floating debt, for he hoped to refund the government
indebtedness; and while he may scarcely seem to deserve commendation
for not attempting to fund the quick liabilities as well, this is not
the case, as the history of the Union Pacific itself can demonstrate.
The Government Directors intended to use the cash procured not only
for settling the floating debt, but also for partially retiring
the prior liens, so under their scheme an assessment was quite
inevitable; and having made that as large as they dared they are not
to be criticised for resorting to the sale of securities for the
additional funds required, especially since these securities were to
have a first lien on the road. As regards the preferred stock it is
not clear from his statement at the time whether Mr. Boissevain had
in mind the exchange of junior securities for bonds and stock or some
for bonds and some for stock alone, but subsequent developments show
that his intention was the former. Thus his idea was the same as that
of the Government Directors, viz., to give the junior bondholders a
right to a low rate of interest well within the earning capacity of
the road, and to join with this the right to a higher return whenever
the road should earn it. Mr. Boissevain’s estimate of the maximum
fixed charges which the road could safely stand was, however, high,
and the plan of the Government Directors, if conservatively carried
out, would have been better. Finally, the Government Directors
contemplated foreclosure, while Mr. Boissevain did not; the relative
merits of the plans on this point depending largely on the terms
which the bondholders could be induced voluntarily to accept.</p>

<p>During 1894 and 1895 discussion was active, both in Congress and out,
while the reorganization committee worked over the scheme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span> which Mr.
Boissevain had put forward, without making any formal announcement of
a plan. Everything depended on the terms upon which the United States
should insist. The reorganization committee hoped for a refunding
of the government debt at 2 per cent. It had suggested that it
would raise the funds to pay off the prior liens if Congress would
take a 2 per cent 50-year bond in satisfaction of the government
claim, would extend the provisions contained in the Reilly Bill to
a committee charged with the duty of purchasing the property of the
Union Pacific, and would grant the committee the power to form a
successor corporation for the general purpose stated in the Acts of
1862 and of 1864, and with the general powers given in those Acts,
together with the same rights, privileges, and freedom of action that
were exercised and enjoyed by other railroads.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> Subsequently it
had offered to pay the principal of the government indebtedness in
cash, providing that the Government would relinquish all claims to
interest.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> If either of these propositions was accepted it was
willing to go ahead; while if both were refused, and no official
counter-proposition was made by the United States, it seemed idle
for the general reorganization committee or any other committee to
promulgate a plan.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the Union Pacific system was disintegrating; partly
from the efforts of the receivers to rid themselves of branches and
contracts which had become burdensome, and partly through the action
of bondholders of subsidiary roads who refused to wait for the slow
action of Congress, and insisted on foreclosure of their liens. As
early as August, 1893, ex-Governor Evans, a prominent stockholder of
the Union Pacific, Denver &amp; Gulf, had petitioned for an accounting
from the Union Pacific, alleging that the branch was being bled for
the advantage of the main line. When receivers for the Union Pacific
system were appointed Mr. Evans petitioned for a separate receiver,
and was granted his request. Litigation followed, and an attempt was
made to get Mr. E. E. Anderson appointed as co-receiver; but the
machinery of foreclosure and sale were duly put in motion and the
line became separated from the parent company. In October, 1893, in
view of an impending default, the Fort Worth &amp; Denver City Railway
Company was placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span> in the hands of receivers, as was the same month
the Denver, Leadville &amp; Gunnison and the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island.
In April, 1894, a receiver was appointed for the Leavenworth, Topeka
&amp; Southwestern; in June one for the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation
Company. Foreclosure proceedings against these and other branches
were instituted, and were attended by a very considerable measure
of success.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> On the other hand, the receivers were anxious to
get rid of onerous contracts and unprofitable branches. On the 16th
of March, 1894, they formally abandoned the Leavenworth, Topeka &amp;
Southwestern. In July, 1894, they petitioned to be relieved from
certain guarantees and contracts, and asked instructions concerning
the operation of certain lines. Judge Sanborn, in the United States
Court at St. Paul, set November 15 for a hearing, and appointed a
special master to take testimony. The master reported in October.
He recommended the continuance of operation of most of the lines in
question, but found that the receivers were not bound by the disputed
contracts; and in November Judge Sanborn confirmed the bulk of his
report. The net result was a reduction in the mileage of the Union
Pacific from 8167 in the latter part of 1893 to 4469 in May, 1895; at
which time proceedings against the Oregon Short Line Railroad Company
threatened to withdraw 1424 miles besides.</p>

<p>With matters in this state the reorganization committee was genuinely
discouraged by the refusal of Congress to pass the Reilly Bill,
providing for a refunding of the government debt; although this had
been reported to the House with the alternative amendment proposed
by the committee accepting the payment in cash of the principal
of the government debt in full satisfaction of claims against the
company.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> Since Congress had earlier refused a proposition to pay
off the prior liens in full on condition that the government debt
be refunded at 2 per cent,<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> it was felt that nothing but cash
payment of principal and interest would be acceptable, and this the
committee refused to undertake. On March 8 the announcement was made
that the reorganization committee of the Union<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span> Pacific road had
abandoned its task and would return the securities deposited with it,
and a few days later the actual disbandment took place.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></p>

<p>Between March, 1895, and the following October little progress was
made. With the dissolution of the general reorganization committee
disappeared the one body capable of formulating a comprehensive
scheme and of securing its widespread acceptance. The committees
which remained represented each some one or two mortgages, and were
thus confined too narrowly in their sympathies to command much
confidence from bondholders as a whole. Late in 1895, however, new
interests undertook the reorganization of the property, and another
general committee was formed, comprising General Louis Fitzgerald;
Marvin Hughitt, president of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern; Chauncey
M. Depew, president of the New York Central; Jacob H. Schiff of
Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.; Oliver Ames, director of the Union Pacific; and
T. Jefferson Coolidge, Jr., president of the Old Colony Trust
Company.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> This committee’s plan of action was noteworthy in three
particulars. First, it contemplated a foreclosure sale. This, it is
true, was but resignation to the inevitable, for foreclosure suits
were already under way, and an attempt to check them would have
had scarcely a possibility of success. Second, it made no definite
provision for the government debt. A certain amount of bonds and
stock were reserved from the securities proposed to be issued for
the purpose of settling the government claim, but the exact method
in which that indebtedness should be treated was left for future
arrangement. Third, it did not attempt to meet the collateral trust
notes of 1891, which constituted so large a portion of the floating
debt. “The securities embraced in these trusts,” it declared,
“are largely those of companies which have already, by orders of
court made in the original general receivership, or in independent
foreclosure proceedings, lost in part or in whole their character as
parts of what has been known as the Union Pacific system. Independent
reorganization of many of these properties are pending. The purposes
which brought into existence guarantees of the obligations of many of
these auxiliary companies have been accomplished by construction or
otherwise, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span> considerations will not exist, upon reorganization,
for continued relations with (them) upon the basis of any assumption
of their fixed charges.”<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> Thus, at the very outset, this new
committee removed the three matters which had given its predecessors
the most trouble. The proposed foreclosure made it both easier to
get assents to a plan and more difficult to block its operation;
the postponement of the question of the government debt allowed the
committee to go ahead without waiting for Congress; and the refusal
to provide for the collateral notes relieved it of many difficulties,
and threw the holders of these notes back upon the collateral which
they had exacted as security.</p>

<p>The plan of the Fitzgerald Committee followed, for the rest, the
general lines earlier laid down by the Brice Committee. To retire all
existing mortgage indebtedness it proposed to issue:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>New common stock exchanged at par for old; new bonds and preferred
stock exchanged for old bonds, with a residue which was to be set off
against the government debt and to be used for cash requirements.
The cardinal principle of the reorganization was that no new 4 per
cent bonds should be issued in exchange where the old mortgage did
not contribute the full value; or, to put it more accurately, that
no securityholders were to be given the right to claim a sum greater
than their property could earn as judged from past experience. At the
same time enough preferred stock was distributed to give bondholders
the same returns as before when the road should earn it. A $15
assessment was levied upon stockholders. This was several times the
quoted price of the stock early in 1896, but was not more than the
stock would probably soon sell for after reorganization. A syndicate
agreed to advance $10,000,000 to $15,000,000, for payment of coupons
as they fell due and for expenses, in return for which they received
$5,000,000 in preferred stock quoted at 59, or 19 per cent on a
capital of $15,000,000 at current prices. In addition the bankers who
managed the syndicate received $1,000,000 in preferred stock; making
a total expenditure of $6,000,000, a not exorbitant commission.
Besides the bonds and stock for strictly reorganization purposes,
there was reserved to dispose of equipment obligations, and for
reorganization and corporate uses, $13,000,000 in 4 per cent bonds
and $7,000,000 in preferred stock. Reorganization uses, as defined
by Mr. Pierce, were those which might arise unprovided for and of
an extraordinary character, all of which could not be foreseen.
Corporate uses were those which would be proper to the corporation
thereafter, such, for instance, as the issue of securities in
extension of the property.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></p>

<p>After all the securities of the old corporation had been accounted
for there remained $35,755,280 of the first mortgage bonds and
$20,864,000 of preferred stock as a fund or resource for the
settlement of the government debt; or, in round numbers, an amount of
4 per cent bonds equal to the principal of that debt and an amount
of preferred stock equal to the accrued interest. Just how this was
to be used the committee did not pretend absolutely to say. “We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
desire to meet any proposition of the Government,” said Mr. Pierce,
“or to suggest any proposition which, after investigation, we believe
will meet the approval of the Government within the limits of the
financial possibilities of the property based upon this plan. In
other words, we have made no sort of a hard and fast rule.” In case
the Government should prove obstinate and should refuse settlement on
reasonable terms, it was the idea of the committee that it would be
entitled on foreclosure to its share as a second mortgage bondholder
only, and that the property would pass under the sale free from all
liens, including that of the United States. “Our view upon that
point,” said Mr. Pierce, “is that when the Government subordinated
its lien to that of the first mortgage bondholders, it did so
deliberately and in terms effective for that purpose. The Government
then consented to all remedies that were necessary for the protection
of this prior lien; and an indispensable element of such priority
would be the right of foreclosure. And unless there was a concealed
purpose on the part of the Government, that right of effective
foreclosure was undoubtedly impliedly granted.”<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></p>

<p>Subsequent negotiations with the bondholders brought a reduction
in the proposed issue of mortgage bonds from $100,000,000 to
$75,000,000, affecting the Kansas Pacific consols and the Union
Pacific Sinking Fund 8s. Thus the former were allotted 50 per cent in
first mortgage 4s and 110 per cent in preferred stock, instead of 80
per cent in 4s and 50 per cent in preferred as before; and the latter
75 per cent in 4s and 100 per cent in preferred stock, instead of
100 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. This reduced the proposed
charges $1,000,000, and proportionately strengthened the scheme.</p>

<p>On the whole, the plan was a strong one. It reduced fixed charges
from over $7,000,000 to under $4,000,000, with an eventual lower
limit of $3,000,000, and this amount such good authorities as Messrs.
Mink and Clark pronounced the road safely able to earn in spite of
the reduction in its mileage.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> During the receivership, moreover,
the system had become purged by the cancellation of onerous contracts
and the lopping off of unprofitable branches, and though some lines
were lost which it was desirable to retain, the Union Pacific was not
precluded from the repurchase of these, and did in fact regain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span> the
most important. The bondholders were put in no worse position than
before, for they could never permanently get more than the earnings
of the road, and this the new distribution of securities generally
assured them. The position of the common stockholders was improved,
for whereas between 1883 and 1893 fixed charges had only once fallen
below $7,300,000, now less than $7,000,000 were to be taken before
their claims were heard, while both the gross and the net earnings
of the road promptly regained their old level. Finally, the general
principle was sound, as has been emphasized several times before.
It gave to each class of securities a claim to interest strictly
proportional to the earning capacity of the road, and added to this
a preferred stock on which no payment was to be made unless earned;
while it provided for a liberal assessment upon stockholders, and
attempted no funding of the current liabilities incurred during the
past troubled years.</p>

<p>The time limit for deposits under the plan was originally set at
December 31, 1895. It was then extended to January 15, 1896, and
later to January 29 of that year. By January 8 the reorganization
committee was able to announce that it had secured majorities of all
of the first mortgage bonds outstanding except an inconsiderable
shortage in one class. This was followed, in spite of some opposition
among London brokers, by the deposit of a majority of the shares
of the company, and by the assent of other securities. In January,
1896, in a letter to the chairman of the House Committee on Pacific
Railways, Mr. Fitzgerald stated that his committee embraced a
substantially single representation of all Union Pacific mortgage
bonds in circulation except those held by the United States.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a></p>

<p>Foreclosure proceedings had been long under way. In January, 1897,
the Government agreed to join in them in consideration of a guarantee
of a bid at least equal to the original amount of government
bonds, less payments made by the company to the Government, with
interest at 3⅓ per cent per annum.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> The guarantee was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span> to be of
cash, so that the Government’s relations with the property would
terminate completely upon confirmation of the sale. This was the
first affirmative action which the Government had taken, and the
reorganization committee accepted it, despairing of better terms.
The guaranteed payment was in part offset by sinking-fund assets of
$17,062,664, leaving a net amount to be provided of $28,691,336.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a>
By August, 1897, foreclosure of the main line had been ordered by
the courts in all the states through which the Union Pacific passed,
both under the first and the government mortgages. Previous to this
the plan of reorganization had been declared operative, and articles
of incorporation for the new company had been filed; while the first
instalment of the assessment on the stock was called by the middle
of the month. An unexpected development now occurred. Although
willing to join in foreclosure proceedings, the Government found the
decrees of foreclosure to some extent unsatisfactory, and prepared
the papers for an appeal. Objection was particularly made to the
fact that the Omaha Bridge mortgage, amounting to about $1,200,000,
was adjudged superior to the lien of the Government on that part of
the road between Omaha and Council Bluffs, and that the money and
assets in the hands of the receivers accruing from the operation of
the roads were ordered to be sold instead of being reserved to meet
a deficiency judgment expected to be obtained. Learning this, the
reorganization committee increased its guarantee by over $4,000,000,
making the total guaranteed bid $50,000,000 instead of $45,754,060.
“This increase,” said the Attorney-General, “removed the objections
to the decrees so far as the money contents were concerned. In all
else the decrees were just and satisfactory.”<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> Even so, perhaps
partly for political reasons, the Government was not ready to allow
a sale, and later in the year gave notice that it would apply for a
postponement to December 15, in order to give Congress an opportunity
to consider the matter. The prospect of renewed congressional
agitation stimulated the reorganization committee to prompt action.
“The Committee,” it declared, “has reached the conclusion that the
interests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span> of the securityholders represented by it and of the
syndicate furnishing the funds to finance the reorganization demand
reorganization without any further delay. In this situation the
committee contemplates ... to oppose any adjournment of the sale of
the main line and to bid it in, if need be, for the full amount of
the Government’s claim, the additional sum involved in this being
$8,000,000.”<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> Postponement of the sale of the Kansas Pacific was
to be allowed, the committee meanwhile making up its mind on what
terms to bid it in. This proposition was telegraphed to Washington
and quickly accepted. It constituted a complete surrender on the part
of the committee, so far as the Union Pacific proper was concerned.
Instead of being refunded, the government debt was paid off in cash;
instead of compromising for the principal alone, both principal
and interest were paid in full. The result reflects credit on the
sharpness of the Attorney-General, but the method was scarcely worthy
of the Government which he represented.</p>

<p>November 1st and 2d, 1897, the property was sold under foreclosure of
the government and first mortgage liens, and the prices were:</p>

<p>On February 12, 1898, the reorganization committee bought in the
Kansas Pacific, guaranteeing for the Government a bid at the sale
which should equal the principal of the government debt, <i>i.
e.</i> $6,303,000.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> Other minor roads were also bought back on
foreclosure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span> sales, and from time to time as the mortgage committee
sold the collateral back of the trust notes of 1891 the Union
Pacific Railroad Company bought portions of the same. In 1899 the
Union Pacific stock was increased $27,460,000, and the new issue
was exchanged share for share with Oregon Short Line stock, thus
regaining control of that important property. Later the same year a
further increase was effected to retire $14,000,000 Oregon Short Line
bonds and $11,000,000 Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation Company preferred
stock. The net result was to avoid any considerable dismemberment
of the system. Whereas 7673.59 miles had been reported for 1892,
5399.01 were reported for 1899. The main line from Portland, Oregon,
to Omaha and Kansas City, via Ogden, Cheyenne, and Denver, was kept
intact, the principal losses being of branch lines in Nebraska and
Kansas.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></p>

<p>A detailed account of the later financial operations of the Union
Pacific divides the company’s recent development into three
parts:<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> First, the regaining of control of the principal
auxiliary systems and branch lines which the receivership had
temporarily separated from the parent stem; second, the purchase of
large amounts of stock in the Southern Pacific and the attempt to
share in the control of the Burlington, which latter involved the
purchase of Northern Pacific stock and the formation of the Northern
Securities Company; and third, the sale of the stock acquired in the
fight over the Burlington, and the subsequent purchase of Alton,
Atchison, Baltimore &amp; Ohio, Illinois Central, and other stocks. The
repurchase of auxiliary lines has just been alluded to; and into the
history of the Burlington struggle there is no need to go at length.</p>

<p>On June 30, 1900, the Union Pacific, Oregon Short Line, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span> Oregon
Railroad &amp; Navigation Companies operated 5427.89 miles of line. The
system stretched from Kansas City and Council Bluffs to Ogden, and
reached the Pacific coast in the Northwest at Portland. It had no
rails of its own in California, but was dependent on the Southern
Pacific tracks for connections both at Ogden and at Portland. The
Southern Pacific extended from New Orleans through Texas, New Mexico,
and Arizona to California, and thence up the coast to Sacramento.
At Sacramento it divided; one line continued north to Portland, and
one turned northeast through Nevada to Ogden, Utah. Now, in 1901
it so happened that the Southern Pacific was for sale. Crocker,
Stanford, and Huntington, who had controlled it, were dead, and their
successors were not eager to retain the railroad as an independent
line. Mr. Harriman seized the opportunity. In 1901 he bought for the
Union Pacific 750,000 shares out of a little less than 2,000,000, and
the following year he increased his holdings to 900,000. The Union
Pacific financed the purchase by the issue of collateral bonds. The
acquisition was of vast importance. Not only did it afford a direct
connection between Ogden and the coast, but it eliminated one of the
Union Pacific’s four great competitors in transcontinental business,
and made Mr. Harriman the dominant figure in the Southwest.</p>

<p>North of the Ogden-San Francisco line the conditions were less
satisfactory. The Great Northern and the Northern Pacific were
here supreme, and in 1901 were negotiating for the purchase of the
Burlington to give them an entrance into Chicago. Mr. Harriman asked
for a share in this purchase but was refused. He thereupon began
to buy Northern Pacific stock in the endeavor to secure by this a
half control in the more eastern road. It was the struggle which
then ensued between Mr. Harriman and Mr. Hill which caused the stock
exchange panic of May, 1901, and which resulted in the formation of
the Northern Securities Company, in which Mr. Harriman was allotted
a large though not a controlling interest. On the breakup of the
Northern Securities Company the Union Pacific received back some
$25,000,000 in Great Northern and $32,000,000 in Northern Pacific
shares,<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> worth at market prices about $100,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
This Northern Securities episode had little effect on traffic
conditions in the Northwest, but it did profoundly influence
the financial policy of the Union Pacific during the following
years.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> The dissolution of the Northern Securities Company gave
to the Union Pacific Great Northern and Northern Pacific shares,
which were valuable as investments only. And as investments these
stocks soon became undesirable. We have said that the combined
value of the securities transferred approximated $100,000,000 at
the time of transfer. From that time on the stocks appreciated
in value till they were worth from $145,000,000 to $150,000,000,
and yielded an income of less than 3 per cent on their market
price. It was good policy to sell them, and $118,000,000 worth
were accordingly disposed of, leaving some $30,000,000 worth still
in the hands of the company.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> What should be done with the
enormous resources thus secured? Some of the cash was used to buy
Chicago &amp; Alton stock,—some of it was put out in demand loans. But
beginning with June 30, 1906, the Union Pacific and Oregon Short
Line began investment in stocks of other companies on a great scale.
$41,442,028 were put into Illinois Central stock; $10,395,000 into
Atchison preferred; $45,466,960 into Baltimore &amp; Ohio, common and
preferred; $19,634,280 into New York Central; and lesser amounts
into Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul, Chicago &amp; Northwestern, St.
Joseph &amp; Grand Island, and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span> companies. In all, $131,693,271
were invested during a little over seven months.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> This has been
the characteristic feature of recent Union Pacific finance. The
large purchases of stock in other roads have assured it favorable
connections in the Illinois Central and in the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, and
have modified the severity of competition with the Atchison.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a>
Including the Southern Pacific, its system reaches from Chicago
to Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the Gulf, and has
an influential voice in two of the principal roads connecting
Chicago with the Atlantic seaboard. At the same time, the extensive
investment of Union Pacific funds to secure gains unconnected with
increase of traffic over its lines has provoked merited criticism.
A railroad is, after all, a machine for transporting passengers and
goods, not an engine of speculation; and both from the point of
view of the community which it serves and of the investors who hold
its securities it is advisable that its income should depend on the
business which its managers conduct and are responsible for, and not
on circumstances over which they have no control. So far as Union
Pacific purchases have been designed to open connections or to modify
competition they have had a sound foundation. So far as they have
been financial operations only they are not to be commended.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a></p>

<p>From the point of view of operation the success of the Union Pacific
has been remarkable. Like most roads it came out of its receivership
in better shape than it went in, but with much lacking for the
efficient and economical handling of its traffic. Since 1900 over
$52,000,000 have been invested in betterments and in new equipment,
of which some $15,000,000 have been withdrawn directly from income.
Maintenance charges have also been liberal, particularly in the last
few years. Grades and curves have been eliminated, steel bridges
have been put in place of wooden, new and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span> heavier rails have been
laid, ballast supplied, and equipment greatly enlarged and improved.
Whereas in 1896 13 per cent of all the Union Pacific system was laid
with iron rails, and only 24 per cent had rails weighing more than
sixty pounds to the yard, in 1907 there was no iron reported, and
only 33 per cent of the track did <em>not</em> have rails weighing more than
sixty pounds to the yard. The average capacity of freight cars was
a shade over twenty tons in February, 1898; it was over thirty-four
tons on June 30, 1907, and the new freight cars added during the
last-named year averaged a capacity of sixty-seven tons apiece.</p>

<p>In consequence of these improvements the Union Pacific has been
able to handle a very greatly increased business. Between 1899 and
1907 the tons of revenue freight carried one mile increased from
1,393,207,990 to 5,704,061,535, and the passengers carried one mile
from 167,117,388 to 680,278,509. This fourfold increase has been
packed away in the larger cars, which in turn have been combined into
longer trains. Twenty-one tons are now put into the average freight
car, and thirty-two freight cars form an average train. In 1899
the average car held twelve tons and twenty-nine of them carried a
train-load. Sixty-six is the average number of passengers per train
to-day; thirty-three was the average number in 1899. And so the
increased business has not occasioned a proportionate growth in cost.
It takes but little more than three times the outlay in conducting
transportation to do over four times the work, and other railroad
expenses have varied even less.</p>

<p>This increased business and less rapidly increasing cost has
meant, finally, an increase in profits, and explains how it has
been possible in seven years to take $15,000,000 from income for
improvements besides liberally maintaining the property. The Union
Pacific is prosperous as it never has been before. In 1907 its
total fixed charges, in round numbers, were $8,600,000, and its net
income was $45,000,000. Of this income $23,500,000 were paid out
in dividends, $1,960,000 appropriated for betterments, additions,
and new equipment, and $10,700,000 carried to surplus. There were
$69,000,000 in bills payable, incurred since 1906, in part for
improvements and the like, but largely in the course of the company’s
financial experiments; but $75,000,000 in convertible bonds have been
authorized to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span> cover them. Stock and bond issues are much larger
than in 1899 and will be larger still when the new convertibles are
all sold. Fixed charges, however, are less than $5,000,000 greater
than they were eight years ago. In order to imperil bond interest
net earnings will have to decline by 81 per cent; and even were this
to happen it is probable that some margin could be retained by a
decrease in the generous sums now being spent for the maintenance of
equipment and of road.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Northern Pacific Railroad Company was chartered in 1864, and
failed in 1875 and in 1893. Besides these bankruptcies it has been
in frequent financial difficulty, and on the whole furnishes an
instructive chapter in a study of reorganizations.</p>

<p>The Act of July 2, 1864,<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> empowered the Northern Pacific
corporation to build a line from some point on Lake Superior, in the
state of Minnesota or Wisconsin, westerly on a line north of the
45th degree of latitude, to a point near or at Portland, Oregon.
It provided for organization on subscription for 20,000 shares out
of an authorized capital of 1,000,000 shares with 10 per cent paid
in, and granted forty alternate sections of public land per mile
throughout the territories, and twenty alternate sections throughout
the states across which the road should pass. This liberal donation
was influenced in part by the fact that the value of lands in the
Northwest was then low, and in part by the refusal of any money
subsidy. The Government was to issue patents on the completion of
stretches of twenty-five miles built in “good, substantial, and
workmanlike manner,” and was to survey lands for forty miles on each
side of the line<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> as fast as the construction of the road should
require. The company was to begin work within two years and was to
finish the line within twelve years, and it was provided that in case
of non-fulfilment of these conditions Congress could do “any and all
acts and things which (might) be needful and necessary to insure a
speedy completion of the road.” A section which gave trouble till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
amended forbade the issue of mortgage or construction bonds, or the
making of a mortgage or lien upon the road in any way except by the
consent of the Congress of the United States. The company was to
obtain the consent of the legislature of any state before commencing
construction through it, and finally the Act was to be void unless
bona fide subscriptions of $2,000,000 to the stock, with 10 per cent
paid in, should be obtained within two years.</p>

<p>A project so daring as the construction of a railroad through the
unsettled Northwest not unnaturally found it difficult to obtain
financial support. The capitalists who at first undertook the
work were unable to carry it through.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> In 1869 and 1870 two
developments occurred: the prohibition of bond issues contained in
the act of incorporation was removed, and Jay Cooke became interested
in the building of the road. Both facts were of far-reaching
importance. Mr. Cooke was one of the foremost financiers of his time.
He was a man of great personal energy, large fortune, and extensive
personal following, and was admirably adapted to the promotion of the
work in hand. The removal of the prohibition upon bond issues made
it possible, with his support, to secure some funds from a mortgage
issue and to allow construction to begin.</p>

<p>In 1869 Jay Cooke &amp; Company were appointed financial agents of
the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. On July 1, 1870, issues of
$100,000,000 in 7.3 per cent first mortgage bonds and $100,000,000
in stock were authorized. The bonds were to be sold to the agents
at 88; the bulk of the stock was to go to the agents as bonus or to
the syndicate interested with them. The same parties agreed to raise
$5,000,000 in cash within thirty days, in order to commence the
building of the line. This made a fair start possible, and by May,
1873, over five hundred miles had been completed. The situation was
nevertheless a difficult one because of the reluctance of capitalists
to invest in the new first mortgage bonds. In 1870 extensive plans
were made to interest the European markets, but all in vain because
of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war. In America a similar
campaign was not much more successful.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> The high price asked
for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span> the bonds,<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> the uncertain nature of the enterprise, the not
altogether ill-founded rumors of extravagance and mismanagement of
the construction actually under way, the presidential election of
1872, all hindered rapid sales. Failure to sell bonds meant financial
stringency for the Northern Pacific. Operating expenses were high,
and the interest on outstanding indebtedness was considerable. On the
other hand, earnings were very small. No through business could be
secured till the completion of the road at least to the Snake River,
and local traffic was yet to be developed. As a result, the company
borrowed more and more from Jay Cooke &amp; Co., and that firm soon found
itself heavily involved.</p>

<p>On September 18, 1873, Jay Cooke &amp; Co. closed its doors. The shock
to the railroad was great. The quotations of first mortgage bonds
dropped from par to about 11. For a time the company struggled on. In
December, 1873, a funding of interest was carried through, whereby
all coupons up to and including that of January 1, 1875, were made
exchangeable for five-year 7 per cent coupon bonds, convertible into
the company’s first mortgage bonds at par, and into the company’s
lands at 25 per cent off from the regular prices.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> In April,
1874, settlement was made with Jay Cooke &amp; Co. by the transfer of
the railroad’s first mortgage bonds and other securities.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> These
measures offered only temporary relief. Business was at a standstill
throughout the country. Gross earnings for the year ending June 30,
1874, were reported to be $988,131, while $30,780,904 7.3 per cent
bonds had been issued, and the floating debt stood at $777,335. The
Northern Pacific was not only unable to meet its fixed charges,
but was in default by a margin which it was hopeless to attempt to
overcome. The original project had completely failed; and the only
means of continuing the enterprise seemed to lie in a government
guarantee of the railroad’s bonds, or in a reorganization so drastic
as to sweep away fixed charges and to give the company a fresh start.</p>

<p>In May, 1874, the first plan was tried. A bill was introduced into
Congress providing that the company should be authorized to issue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
its 5 per cent thirty-year bonds for $50,000 per mile on its entire
line, complete and incomplete, and that on completed sections of
the road twenty miles long it should deliver its 7.3 per cent bonds
at a rate of $50,000 per mile, receiving in return $40,000 of the
5 per cent bonds with interest but not principal guaranteed by the
Government, which should hold the difference of $10,000 as a reserve
fund. Holders of outstanding 7.3 per cent bonds were to have the
right of exchanging their bonds for new 5s on the same terms.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a>
In return for the guarantee the railroad was to surrender to the
United States Government its entire land grant, to be sold under
the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and to turn over
semi-annually its entire net earnings. The Government was to have
the right in addition to sell the Northern Pacific 5 per cent bonds
whenever the combined yield of the land grant and the net earnings
should not equal the interest guaranteed. Finally, Congress was to
have power to fix fares, etc., provided that the government control
did not impair the security of the bonds. In brief, the capitalists
who had involved themselves in Northern Pacific affairs were ready to
surrender their whole enterprise to the Government if the Government
would carry it through. But Congress was so little willing to take
the responsibility that the bill never came to a vote.</p>

<p>Early in 1875, while the application for government aid was still
pending, the directors called a general meeting of the bondholders.
When it assembled President Cass made a statement of the financial
condition of the company. The outstanding debt, said he, was
$30,441,300. Of the 7.3 per cent bonds issued as collateral for
floating debt, mostly in 1875, there had been pledged $1,780,300
at the rate of from twenty-five to forty cents on the dollar. The
interest on land warrants, bonds, and scrip given in funding of
coupons amounted to $732,632. The floating debt was $634,758, of
which $150,000 were arranged for settlement within a few days; and
$250,000 were due to directors for money advanced to finish the
Pacific section after the failure of Jay Cooke &amp; Co. in 1873. The
total net earnings to date had been $124,056, and the capital stock
was $25,497,600. By this report it seems that some slight advance
had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span> made since June, 1874, but in no measure which afforded
any hope for the continued solvency of the company. Most instructive
were the figures for the floating debt, which in less than five
years had increased to a sum more than five times the net earnings
for the whole period. After some discussion the bondholders elected
a committee of seven to report at a future meeting. The committee
recommended a receivership, the directors did not oppose, and on
April 16 General Cass was appointed receiver, resigning his position
as president to accept.</p>

<p>By this time hope of government aid had vanished, and no time was
lost in accepting the alternative of a drastic reorganization.
Late in May the bondholders’ committee reported a plan which was
considered by the bondholders at subsequent meetings. The principle
was simple, and the means sufficient. The company had earned .4 per
cent on its funded debt:—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ergo</i>, the funded debt was to be swept
away. Fixed charges had been heavy:—they were now to be completely
removed. Scarcely less would have met the needs of the situation,
but the merit in refusing to tinker and experiment was considerable.
In more extended shape the plan was as follows: Reorganization was
to be carried out through foreclosure, and a committee of six was
appointed to take charge. All outstanding bonds were to be replaced
by preferred stock, and all common stock was to be exchanged for
new common stock. Floating debt was to be likewise exchanged for
preferred stock, which was to be issued to the amount of $51,000,000
for the following purposes:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To retire the principal of the outstanding 7.3 per cent bonds,
and the interest to and including July 1, 1878, at 8 per cent,
currency.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To retire the land warrant bonds, principal and interest, to
and including January 1, 1875.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To pay the floating debt not protected under the existing
orders of the court.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Generally for the purpose of carrying the plan into effect.</p>

<p>Preferred stock was to have all rights and privileges of common
stock, with the right to vote, and was to be entitled to 8 per cent
out of net earnings before anything should be paid on the common, and
to one-half the surplus after 8 per cent should have been declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
on both preferred and common.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> It was to be convertible at par
into any lands belonging to the company, or thereafter to belong
to it, east of the Missouri River in the state of Minnesota or the
territory of Dakota, until default should occur in some of the
provisions of the new first mortgage bonds, and the proceeds of all
sales of such land were to be used in extinguishing the stock. Common
stock was to be issued to the amount of $49,000,000, and was to be
given to old stockholders share for share. To provide the means to
complete and to equip the road there were to be issued first mortgage
bonds not to exceed an average of $25,000 per mile of road, actually
completed and accepted by the President of the United States, to be
secured by a first mortgage on the whole line of road, constructed
or to be constructed, and on the equipment, property, lands, and
franchises, including the franchise to be a corporation, subject only
to the right of the holders of the preferred stock to convert their
stock into lands. The principal was to be payable in forty years, and
the interest and sinking fund might be made payable in gold. No other
bonds were to be issued except on a vote of at least three-quarters
of the preferred stock at a meeting specially held in reference
thereto on thirty days’ notice. Subsequently it was resolved, and
the resolution incorporated in the plan, that the holders of the
common stock should have no voting power until on and after July 1,
1878, and that no assessment should be levied upon bondholders; but
that the cost of purchase and the expense of foreclosure and other
proceedings should be paid out of the assets and the income of the
company.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></p>

<p>Applying to this plan the same tests to which all other plans have
been subjected, it appears that from the point of view of the
corporation it left little to be desired. The general depression
throughout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span> the country and the needs of the Northern Pacific
Railroad in particular were so great that for once, in the conflict
of interests between the bondholders and the corporation, the latter
had all the advantage on its side. As a matter of fact, had any
attempt been made in this case, as so frequently in others of recent
years, to unite in the exchange of new securities for old a bond and
a stock as an equivalent for an outstanding bond, instead of giving
stock only, the rate of interest on the new bond would necessarily
have been so low as to deprive the combination of its attractiveness.
That resource was not had to an income bond was perhaps due to the
absence of English investment in the road. The wise course was the
one pursued:—namely, to retire bonds with a fixed lien on earnings
by stock which represented ownership in the enterprise, and which
could claim dividends only when earned. The floating debt was not
retired by an assessment but by new securities. This again, all
things considered, was wise. The existing stock represented so little
actual investment in the property that holders would doubtless have
refused to pay an assessment, and would have surrendered their
certificates instead; while it would have been both difficult to
collect an assessment on the depreciated bonds, and hard to convince
bondholders of the justice of a demand for such a contribution, so
long as the stockholders were let off unscathed. On the other hand,
whether or not an assessment would have yielded cash, the issue
of stock for floating debt did not increase the fixed charges of
the road, and was not, therefore, fundamentally unsound. Liberal
provision was made for future capital requirements, and the only
provision to which exception could have been taken was the limitation
of bond issues to the moderate figure of $25,000 per mile except with
the consent of three-quarters of the preferred stockholders. On the
whole, the plan put the company fairly on its feet, presented it with
all the work which had been accomplished, and bade it attempt again
the project in which its failure had previously been so complete.
The danger of future bankruptcy lay in this fact only: that a large
section of the road was yet uncompleted, and through business was
non-existent; that the Northwest was still unsettled, and the local
business was small; in short, that so much was yet to be done that
the company, with all the advantages which it now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span> possessed, might
fail again for the same reasons which had led it into bankruptcy
before.</p>

<p>The plan was first reported on May 20,<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> and was laid before
the bondholders on the 30th of June. There was some protest that
it proposed giving away the property of the bondholders, and the
additional sections before mentioned, concerning the expenses of the
reorganization and the voting power of the common stock were added.
By August nearly two-thirds of the bondholders had assented.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a>
By May a decree of sale had been obtained, which was modified in
August so as to give bondholders priority over claims of directors
for advances made; and on August 12 all the property of the company,
except the patented and certified lands,<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> with all its rights,
liberties, and franchises, was sold at public auction and bought in
by a purchasing committee for $100,000.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> No upset price was set
by the Court; and it was surmised that the bid was purposely made low
in order to force non-assenting bondholders to accept the new stock.
The new corporation was organized in October, 1875, by the election
of Mr. Chas. B. Wright of Philadelphia as president, and with the
denial of a petition to set aside the sale the reorganization may be
said to have been concluded.</p>

<p>For fourteen years the company was now to be free from talk of
further reorganization, and not until 1893 was there to be another
receivership. During this time the mileage, owned or controlled,
was to be made continuous from the Pacific coast to Chicago, and
the Northern Pacific was to mount high among American railroads in
its extent and in the volume of its business. In 1875 the completed
mileage was, roughly, 550 miles of line; in 1893 it was 5431.92,
and reached from Ashland, St. Paul, and Minneapolis on the east to
Portland, Olympia, Tacoma, and Seattle on the west. In the former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
year the gross earnings were $414,722 and the net $97,478; in the
latter the totals were $23,920,109 and $11,416,283. At the same
time the fixed charges rose from nothing to $14,311,430, and the
bonds outstanding to $133,545,500, besides $15,349,000 of bonds of
subsidiary companies guaranteed. It appears, therefore, that the
promoters were successful in raising funds for the completion of
their enterprise, although their road suffered at first from the thin
population of the Northwest and the lack of a through connection, and
then from the competition of other transcontinental lines.</p>

<p>From the reorganization to 1879 very little was done in the way
of new construction, owing to the general financial depression.
Efforts to get the time allowed for completing the road extended
failed, however, and it became necessary to resume in order to keep
Congress contented and to avoid a forfeiture of the land grant.
In 1878 a small loan was placed, and the following year one for a
somewhat larger amount; and with the funds so secured construction
was vigorously pushed. More liberal provision was made in 1880–1,
when successful negotiations were carried through for the sale to a
syndicate of $40,000,000 general mortgage 6 per cent railroad and
land-grant bonds, to be issued at the rate of $25,000 per mile of
finished road only, and to be secured by a mortgage on the entire
property of the company except the lands east of the Missouri River,
which were pledged for the redemption of the preferred stock.
Provision was made for a reserve of these bonds sufficient to
retire the prior issues before mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> Under the agreement
the syndicate took $10,000,000 at once and had an option of taking
$10,000,000 per year in each of the next three years. The reported
price was 90 for the first $10,000,000 and 92½ for the rest. As a
matter of fact, the whole $40,000,000 had been turned over by the end
of 1883, and though the effect on the company is seen in the increase
in its bonded indebtedness from $3,881,884 in 1880 to $39,522,200
in 1883, and in its fixed charges from $334,482 to $2,478,939, it
was meanwhile supplied with cash, and was enabled to advance toward
the completion of the 1000 miles of line which remained unbuilt.
The financial embarrassment which was felt in 1882, in spite of the
syndicate contract, was due to an unforeseen cause. According to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
statements of the company, it was felt necessary, in order to avoid
waste of time and money, to build simultaneously from both ends of
the line, and to start all the heavy work on the entire route at
once. “This involved the shipment of millions of dollars’ worth of
track material, motive power, and rolling stock to the Pacific coast
many months before their actual use on the road; and on the line east
of the Rocky Mountains very large expenditures of cash a long time
before the works resulting from them could become parts of finished
road.”<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> The expenses were immediate;—the delivery of bonds to
the syndicate could take place by the terms of the contract only
after the completion of finished sections of road, so that great
stringency easily occurred between. The trouble was only temporary,
and was tided over with the help of the syndicate and of the Oregon &amp;
Transcontinental Company, a corporation of which we shall presently
speak.</p>

<p>As the Northern Pacific pushed into the Northwest, and at the same
time vigorously occupied itself in filling the gap between the
ends of its main line, it came into contact with a combination of
Northwestern companies known as the Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation
Company, of which Henry Villard was at the time in control. This
corporation owned a line of steamboats running on the Willamette and
Columbia rivers in Oregon, together with an ocean line connecting
Portland and San Francisco.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> In connection with the water
routes a narrow-gauge road had been built up the left bank of the
Columbia River to a connection near the mouth of the Snake River
with an existing narrow-gauge road to the town of Walla Walla in
Southeastern Washington; and this narrow-gauge was being widened,
in 1880, to standard. This was the very territory through which the
Northern Pacific expected to make its connection with the Pacific
coast; and in 1880 it had passed the Rocky Mountains and had reached
the confluence of the Columbia and the Snake. On October 20, 1880,
a contract was signed between the Northern Pacific and the Oregon
Railway &amp; Navigation Companies whereby the former, among other
things, consented to a division of territory with the Snake and the
Columbia rivers as the dividing-line; in return for which the latter
agreed to complete a standard-gauge road within three years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span> from the
western end of the Northern Pacific, at the mouth of the Snake River,
to Portland, and to grant the Northern Pacific the right, without
the obligation, to run its own trains over it at a fixed charge per
train mile. It will be remembered that the Northern Pacific was not
at this time too easy in its finances, so that it was quite willing
to secure connection with the coast without outlay of its own. Soon
after the execution of the contract, however, the $40,000,000 loan
earlier described was arranged for, and Mr. Villard feared that the
road would build its own connection with Portland now that the means
seemed to be at hand. To prevent it he conceived no less a plan
than that of forming a new company which should purchase and hold
a controlling interest in both the Northern Pacific and the Oregon
Railway &amp; Navigation Companies.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> This was done, and the new
corporation, known as the Oregon &amp; Transcontinental Company, for a
long time played a prominent part in Northern Pacific affairs;<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a>
aiding it in the construction of the main and branch lines, and time
and again advancing money when the road was in straits.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a></p>

<p>The formation of the Oregon &amp; Transcontinental Company put Mr.
Villard in control of the Northern Pacific. Mr. Villard’s financial
strength in later years was due mainly to the support of German
interests, notably the Deutsche Bank of Berlin; but his hold on the
bank and on his followers was partly due to his real ability and
resourcefulness, and partly to his confident predictions of results
which sometimes he was but frequently was not able to attain. One of
the company’s first acts after his appearance was the declaration
of a scrip dividend upon the preferred stock. The question had been
raised in the course of his fight for control, and he perhaps felt it
incumbent upon himself to show the sincerity of his contentions; at
any rate, the annual report for 1882 contained a statement that the
surplus earnings since 1875 had been used for construction instead
of being distributed as dividends, and that the sum of $4,667,490
was therefore properly due to the preferred stock. On the strength
of this the directors resolved that a dividend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span> of 11.1 per cent
be declared, for which there were to be issued obligations of the
company bearing 6 per cent interest, payable at the end of five
years, but redeemable after one year at the pleasure of the company
upon thirty days’ notice, in amounts of not less than 20 per cent to
each holder. The policy thus initiated was plainly non-conservative
and unsound. It may be true that as a general principle new
construction should be paid for out of capital rather than out of
income account, yet this is subject to qualifications; and the
Northern Pacific had been and was in so precarious a condition that
not a dollar of its resources could safely have been alienated.
The sequel came in 1883 when the annual report admitted that there
had been an excess of expenditures on account of construction and
equipment of $7,986,508 over the cash receipts from the proceeds of
the $40,000,000 general mortgage bonds, sales of preferred stock,
and other sources;<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> and when by October of the same year the
deficit had been increased to $9,459,921, and a circular from
President Villard stated the additional cash requirements to amount
to $5,500,000.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a></p>

<p>Relief had to be sought in an increase of indebtedness. On October
6, 1883, the directors authorized a second mortgage for $20,000,000
upon the property, subject to the consent of three-fourths of the
preferred stock, and in a circular explained that they had accepted
a proposition of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., Winslow, Lanier &amp; Co., and
August Belmont &amp; Co. to take $15,000,000 of the issue at 87½, less
5 per cent commission in bonds, with a six months’ option to take
$3,000,000 more on the same terms. The stockholders assented,—they
could do nothing else,—a suit for an injunction was denied, and the
syndicate exercised its option. The result was an increase in bonds
issued from $39,522,200 to $61,635,400, of which the greater part was
accounted for by the new mortgage.</p>

<p>By August 22, 1883, the gap in the Northern Pacific main line had
been filled up, and on September 8 the formal opening occurred. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
mileage in operation was then 2365, of which 1952.5 was main line and
412.8 branches, and the rapid construction of the last 1000 miles
had done credit to most of those concerned. The total capitalization
per mile was $59,304, of which less than one-third represented
bonds; and though the following year this percentage was increased,
the proportion of mortgage to total issues remained considerably
under one-half. This showing was very favorable, and accounts for
the success with which the Northern Pacific withstood the panic of
1884. With the completion of its through line, moreover, earnings
increased so materially as to cover the interest on the new bonds;
and though the road was never to enjoy a monopoly of transcontinental
traffic, in February, 1883, it had concluded an agreement with the
Union Pacific concerning through rates and a division of territory,
and a period of prosperity was hoped for. Meanwhile the Oregon &amp;
Transcontinental Company had been hard hit by the decline in Northern
Pacific stock, due to the publication of the construction deficit.
The straits of his company affected Mr. Villard; and in spite of the
relief afforded by the Northern Pacific second mortgage he “became
conscious that neither himself nor the Oregon &amp; Transcontinental
Company could be saved.”<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> On January 4, 1884, the directors
accepted his resignation, and soon after Robert Harris, then
vice-president of the Erie, was elected to fill his place.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></p>

<p>The years immediately following the issue of the second mortgage
and the completion of the road were not uneventful, although it is
not necessary to describe them at length. The insolvency of the
Oregon &amp; Transcontinental, and continued disputes between it and the
Northern Pacific over an adjustment of the two companies’ financial
relations, made some other means of binding the Oregon Railway &amp;
Navigation with the Northern Pacific seem advisable, and a lease of
the former company to the latter was discussed. In July, 1884, an
arrangement was said to have been actually arrived at on the basis of
a guarantee by the Northern Pacific of 6 per cent on the Navigation
stock for two years, 7 per cent for three years, and 8 per cent
in perpetuity; but the interest was very high, and an injunction
helped to prevent a consummation at the time. In 1885<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span> the idea of
a joint lease by the Northern Pacific and Union Pacific railroad
companies came to the front. The Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation was
serving as the Northwestern outlet for both of these roads, and such
a contract would have greatly simplified the competitive situation,
besides taking away from the Navigation Company the power to exact an
excessive pro-rate because of its double connection.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> During the
next few years negotiations were almost constantly in progress. In
1887, however, the Navigation Company was leased to the Oregon Short
Line with a Union Pacific guarantee; and upon the failure of renewed
negotiations Mr. Villard, who was again in power, sold the Oregon &amp;
Transcontinental Company’s holdings of Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation
Company stock at a “satisfactory” price. This consummation was less
unfavorable to the Northern Pacific because of its completion of a
line of its own to the Pacific coast.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> From now on the Oregon
&amp; Transcontinental Company existed only as a means of obtaining
financial assistance for the Northern Pacific, and for making more
easy the control of that company’s stock.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></p>

<p>While these operations were going on the Northern Pacific once
more found it advisable to increase its indebtedness, and added a
third mortgage of $12,000,000 to the first and second mortgages
which already have been described. Of the issue $8,000,000 were at
once taken by a syndicate, and the $4,000,000 remaining were early
disposed of to the same parties. The mortgage was said to be for the
purpose of completing new work and for paying the floating debt;
it also assisted in the redemption and refunding of the dividend
scrip which had been issued to preferred stockholders in 1883; and
the payment of $3,073,321 of this in cash, besides the extension of
$1,567,500 more, now took place. The extended scrip was to be payable
in 1907, to bear 6 per cent, and to be redeemable on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span> thirty days’
notice on any interest day on or after 1892; and up to January 1,
1893, holders had the option of converting it into third mortgage
bonds.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> The third mortgage itself required the consent of
three-quarters of the preferred stockholders, but this there seems to
have been little difficulty in securing.</p>

<p>The years 1886–9 saw also a considerable extension of branch and
other construction. It was a time of great general activity. In
another place the large additions to the Atchison system have been
described; at the same time the Union Pacific grew from a system of
5825.6 miles in 1886 to one of 6996 in 1889, adding over 1100 miles;
the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific increased from 1384.2 to 1592.7;
the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy from 4036 to 5140.8; and the St.
Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba from 1509.4 to 3030.1. Meanwhile the
Northern Pacific added 656.8 miles, or an average of 219 miles a
year.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> In the far Northwest the great tunnel through the Cascade
Mountains was nearly completed by May, 1888; and by the end of the
following year a continuous line of road was in operation from
Ashland, Wisconsin, to Portland, Oregon, which was of particular
service in view of the difficulties with the Oregon Railway &amp;
Navigation Company, and was the reason for the willingness of the
Northern Pacific to surrender control of that connection.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> In
1888, also, negotiations were carried on with the Canadian Government
for an extension into Manitoba; and the same year the Cœur d’Alene
Railroad &amp; Navigation Company was purchased, comprising a steamship
and narrow-gauge line in Northeastern Washington which extended
through the mining region of the same name.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> Generally speaking,
the Northern Pacific retained its character as a single-track
transcontinental route with but few branches. Where it did expand was
on the east, where it reached Duluth, Ashland, Superior, St. Paul,
and Minneapolis, and on the west, where it joined Wallula, Portland,
and Tacoma. The principal other branches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span> were the ones mentioned:
namely, those to Winnipeg, and to the mining districts in Montana and
Washington.</p>

<p>In spite of its moderation the Northern Pacific was not
over-prosperous. Its passenger earnings remained small, being
scarcely greater in 1888 than they had been in 1884; and while its
freight earnings increased from $7,867,367 in 1884 to $10,426,245
in 1888, and to $15,600,320 in 1889, this was so far offset by
increased operating expenses that the increase in net earnings
from both passengers and freight was only $2,223,194. Construction
meanwhile caused an increase in funded indebtedness outstanding of
$15,202,000, to say nothing of $20,981,000 of branch-line bonds which
the road by 1889 had guaranteed; and the floating debt began to grow
uncomfortably large.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> At the same time, if Mr. Villard is to be
believed, officials in charge of the operation of the road were eager
for appropriations for the improvement of the track, the replacement
of wooden by metal bridges, additional motive power and rolling
stock, enlargement of terminal facilities, and the purchase and
construction of new lines. The truth was that the problem of getting
the road built had been more important than that of how it was to
be built; so that much work had been done in a hasty and imperfect
manner which it was now advisable to renew.</p>

<p>Since, then, there was need for additional capital, while it was
unsafe to increase the fixed charges of the road, the managers felt
called upon to devise a scheme whereby these circumstances should
both, at least in appearance, be met. Their solution was the proposal
of a large refunding mortgage to retire as soon as possible existing
mortgages, and to provide a balance which could be spent upon the
line. If, they argued, bondholders could be induced to accept new 4
per cent or even 5 per cent bonds in exchange for their 6 per cent
securities, the road would be free to issue new additional bonds
until the margin of charges so obtained should have been taken up.
The plan was worthy of its ingenious promoter, Mr. Villard, and will
be criticised in the proper place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
On September 19, 1889, the managers issued a circular to the
preferred stockholders. “In the opinion of the Directors,” said they,
“the time has come to make new financial provision on a liberal scale
for the growing needs of the Company.” Then followed a statement of
gross earnings. “A further corresponding increase may be expected
in the present fiscal year, which will bring the gross earnings up
to $23,000,000 or $24,000,000.... But the Company could not in the
past, and will not be able hereafter, to take full advantage of this
auspicious situation without further large investments of capital.
Secondly.—The prosperity of the road attracts competition.... The
Company must be prepared to build additional feeders wherever and
whenever the local developments warrant, and the danger of hostile
occupancy appears.... Another strong [motive] lies in the Company’s
ownership of a large land grant, the benefits of which cannot be
fully realized without the promotion of settlements through the
construction of branch lines. The Board is also of opinion that
the time has come to make such provision, that the Company may
take advantage of its high credit to effect a reduction of fixed
charges.”<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></p>

<p>It was proposed to issue a $160,000,000 one hundred-year consolidated
mortgage, bearing interest not to exceed 5 per cent, to cover the
entire Northern Pacific Railroad, together with its equipment, land
grant, branch lines, and securities of branch lines. This was to be
applied as follows:</p>

<table summary="uses of proposed consolidated mortgage">

    <td> </td></tr>
</table>

<p>Only a portion of these securities was, therefore, to be issued at
once. The provision for enlargement of terminals, etc., was likely
to call for early issues, as might a portion of that reserved for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
new branches and for general purposes. It was expected that a certain
amount of branch-line bonds could be retired without much delay.
On the whole, the bonds immediately put forth were not expected to
exceed $15,000,000; though there was nothing in the plan to prevent a
greater issue. The interest rate was “not to exceed 5 per cent.” That
this wording was deliberately adopted is shown by the terms of the
mortgage, which expressly gave to the company the power to issue the
new bonds, from time to time, bearing such a rate of interest as the
managers might think advisable up to 5 per cent. It was understood
that the issue was to be in three classes, one of $57,000,000 to
bear 5 per cent, one of $23,000,000 to bear 4½ per cent, and one of
$80,000,000 to bear 4 per cent; and on this basis it was thought
that fixed charges would be reduced $2,000,000, to which would have
to be added interest on bonds issued in excess of those previously
outstanding.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> The reserve of $10,000,000 for premiums shows that
in the opinion of the directors the offer of substantially more
than par in new bonds was necessary in order to induce exchanges of
old bonds for new. To prevent careless use of this reserve it was
provided that the $10,000,000 in bonds could be used to pay premiums
only upon the affirmative vote of at least nine members (out of
thirteen) of the board, and when in the opinion of the trustees,
expressed in writing, a saving of interest to the company could be
effected.</p>

<p>Not the least important part of the plan was that designed to
gain the preferred stockholders’ approval. It will be remembered
that by the terms of the reorganization of 1875 the consent of
three-quarters of these stockholders was necessary to validate
any mortgage after the first mortgage then proposed. The increase
in indebtedness now suggested threatened to postpone indefinitely
dividends on the preferred, and could not be expected to be welcome.
In consequence, the directors offered three distinct inducements:
first, a promise of a distribution to the preferred stockholders of
sums which had been taken from earnings and spent on the property
to date; second, a promise of early and regular dividends in the
future; third, a preferential right of subscription to the new
bonds. By resolution of August 21, 1889, they therefore definitely
declared in favor of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span> distribution of a sum equal to the earnings
which should be found to have been applied in earlier years to
the capital requirements of the property. An investigation was
made, the amount was officially declared to be $2,844,430, and an
equivalent amount of new bonds at 85 was set aside to cover it. For
the future Mr. Villard and his associates announced a determination
to begin dividends at the rate of 4 per cent, the first to be paid
January 1, 1890; and declared that thereafter dividends would
be paid out of the current net earnings, or, if these should be
insufficient, out of a reserve fund until the net earnings should
justify a larger distribution. Finally, it was provided that the
common and preferred stockholders should be given the privilege of
subscribing to the new bonds at 85 to the extent of 15 per cent
of their holdings. That these concessions attracted attention was
shown by the action of the preferred stockholders in calling for
an actual distribution as soon as possible of the amounts deducted
from earnings in past years. On October 17, 1889, they passed a
resolution recommending to the incoming board of directors “to take
into consideration the distribution of the whole amount due to the
Preferred Stock, under the plan of reorganization, as soon as the
Company shall be financially in a proper position to do so;”<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> and
again the following year they resolved “that the incoming Board of
Directors be ... requested to set apart the additional earnings in
... consolidated bonds ... and to (consider) the question of either
increasing the ... dividend above 4 per cent or of declaring an extra
dividend to the preferred stock.”<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></p>

<p>All things considered it is improbable that the refunding plan
could have been put through without the promise of dividends to the
preferred stock, but it remains unfortunate that such promises had
to be made. The money which had been put into the road had been of
necessity so invested to preserve the solvency of the company. In a
sense it had increased earning power, but not all expenditures which
affect earnings may be charged to capital. In the first place, if
earnings are below fixed charges, or are constantly tending to fall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
below, sums put into the property merely assist the company to keep
its head above water, and are not a sound basis for an increase in
indebtedness; and in the second place expenditures which serve to
<em>preserve</em> earnings may not be charged to capital account, even when
the method of preservation is the construction of branch lines, and
still less when the method is the improvement of the existing plant.
If, then, as was the case, the earnings claimed by the preferred
stockholders had gone to preserve the solvency of the company, and to
defend it against competition, the arguments of these stockholders in
1889 did not hold good.</p>

<p>As for the plan itself, it was simply a method for providing new
capital, and should be judged as such. Its refunding provisions
were mainly misleading. It proposed to secure a reduction in fixed
charges by the exchange of bonds bearing 5 per cent or less for bonds
bearing 6 per cent, but how the reduction was to be accomplished was
not clear. The maturity of the bonds to be retired was remote, and
the assured reduction was therefore also remote. The first mortgage
had been issued in 1881, and ran for forty years; the second dated
from 1882 and was to mature after fifty years; and the third, which
had been issued only the year before, was not redeemable until 1937.
The Missouri division and Pend d’Oreille mortgages matured somewhat
earlier,<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> but had nevertheless a considerable time to run. The
mortgage issues would therefore not soon fall in of themselves.
Secondly, bondholders would evidently not consent voluntarily to
surrender old unexpired bonds without such a premium in new bonds as
would make their annual return approximately the same. Something they
might concede in view of the more remote maturity of the new issue
and the somewhat more inclusive character of its mortgage lien, but
not enough to create any considerable saving.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> The new issues
for improvement of the road, moreover, involved an <em>increase</em> in
the annual interest payments; which we must not, perhaps, condemn
offhand, for the raising of capital was in some measure forced upon
the company, but which is important in considering the railroad’s
financial condition and prospects. The fact was that the Northern
Pacific was not self-supporting; it had been obliged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span> to issue
$20,867,000 bonds of its own and to guarantee $20,981,000 besides,
between 1884 and 1889, in order to secure an advance of $2,462,288 in
annual net income during a period of rapidly increasing prosperity;
and it was now obliged to increase this indebtedness in the attempt
to maintain its solvency for the future.</p>

<p>Between 1889 and the end of 1892 business increased, and net
earnings at first gained more rapidly than did fixed charges. Mr.
Villard was again supreme in the management, and actively directed
financial operations until his departure for Europe in 1890. The
most important operation conducted was the lease of the Wisconsin
Central, whereby the eastern terminus of the Northern Pacific
system was transferred from St. Paul and Minneapolis to Chicago.
The directors who were elected with Mr. Villard in 1887 controlled
the Wisconsin Central and the Terminal Company, which had been
formed to secure an entrance for that road into the Lake city.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a>
Perhaps because of this financial interest, the conviction seems
to have crept over them that the Northern Pacific would do well to
make connection with the trunk lines at Chicago, instead of stopping
further west; and they brought the subject up in 1889, and again in
1890. On July 1, 1889, a traffic contract went into effect, under
which the Northern Pacific obtained the use of the Wisconsin Central
lines in consideration of the business which it should turn over
to them. Certain provisions imposed on both roads a share of the
operating expenses whenever the proportion of operating expenses to
gross earnings was greater than 65 per cent, and which gave both a
profit whenever the proportion fell below this level. The Wisconsin
Central retained entire and absolute control of its own property,
except that the Northern Pacific was to share in the profits of the
subsidiary Terminal Company whenever these profits should be more
than $800,000.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> This was considered unsatisfactory, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the Northern Pacific had no control of the Central’s operation; and
on April 1 of the following year a new contract gave to the former
a lease of all the lines owned and controlled by the Wisconsin
Central Company and the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company between
St. Paul and Chicago for 999 years; including terminal facilities at
Chicago held by the Chicago &amp; Northern Pacific Railroad Company, a
subsidiary corporation.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> “It was deemed by the Board,” said the
annual report, “as of the utmost importance that your road should
have access to the city of Chicago by a line in its own ownership
and possessed with terminal facilities which it could control and
have possession of. The whole subject was most carefully considered
by the Board, and the contracts and leases were adopted after
deliberate and careful consideration.”<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> The advantage of this
lease to the Wisconsin Central lay in the large volume of traffic
which the arrangement secured to it; that to the Northern Pacific
was more doubtful. Connection with Chicago was desirable, but it was
to prove difficult to operate the Wisconsin Central for 65 per cent,
and the acquisition was to arouse the hostility of all the other
roads between Chicago and St. Paul. We shall see that the lease was
presently given up and that the attempt to make Chicago the eastern
terminus was for the time abandoned.</p>

<p>The year 1891 was a good one, but during the following twelve months
the situation changed for the worse. Most noteworthy was an increase
in fixed charges of over $2,000,000, due in part to an increase in
the funded indebtedness, but more largely to an increase in rentals
paid. This increase brought charges above total net income, and shows
how serious the position of the company had become. In fact, the
company’s repeated issues of bonds had failed so completely to put
it in a stable position that in but three of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span> nine years from
1884 to 1892 was a surplus greater than $500,000 above fixed payments
secured, while the operations of two of these same years resulted in
a deficit.</p>

<p>The first admission by directors that the road was in difficulty
consisted in the passing of the preferred stock dividend for March
31, 1892. That this action did not deprive the holders of all
return was due to the previous conversion of the consols formerly
reserved into a trust for ten years on which to draw whenever the
road should be unable to pay the usual dividends. The directors
therefore added to their declaration of suspension a resolution
that the “time, manner, and method of the distribution of so many
of the $3,347,000 of consolidated bonds set aside for the benefit
of the preferred stockholders as may be necessary to supply the
deficiency, if any, in this or any subsequent fiscal year, between
the amount of net earnings and 4 per cent on the preferred stock, be
submitted to preferred stockholders at the annual meeting in October
next.”<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> Not unnaturally stockholders were alarmed. At the annual
meeting in October an investigating committee was appointed,<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a>
and proceeded to a careful examination of the property accompanied
by certain officers of the road. The committee was not friendly to
the management. Its preliminary report announced that the physical
condition of the system was good, but its later criticism of the
company’s financial condition was severe. In the words of the London
<cite>Standard</cite> “there has been no such scathing arraignment of Directors
since the exposures of the Erie Railway.” The committee stated that
the bad condition of the property was due to the reckless financial
methods of the directors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span> It alleged that officers had held dual
positions, and had subordinated the interests of the Northern Pacific
Company to those of the Wisconsin Central, relieving themselves at
the expense of the former road. It commented upon the unprofitable
character of certain of the other branches. The floating debt, it
maintained, had been financed by Mr. Villard personally at double
the current rates of interest, and it recommended litigation in
default of some assurance that the policy of the company should be
changed.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> In reply the directors issued a lengthy statement
taking up the charges in detail. The policy of building branch lines,
said they, was imperatively necessary in order to develop business.
Although some of the branches had not earned their fixed charges,
yet, if they had been credited with 60 per cent of the gross earnings
on business which they had brought to the main line, they would have
shown a good profit. The policy of branch-line construction had
met with the unanimous approval of successive boards of directors,
and had been ratified by the stockholders in 1886; and in this
connection the reply defended specifically the acquisition of the
Wisconsin Central and other lines. The carrying of the floating debt
by officials interested in the property, instead of being subject to
criticism and censure, was entitled to the highest commendation.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to pass with justice upon the conflicting contentions
above outlined. However, writing in 1905, long after his retirement
from Northern Pacific affairs, Mr. Villard expressed himself as
follows: “In 1891 Mr. Villard ... made ... his last official tour of
inspection of the main line and principal branches of the Northern
Pacific.... The most alarming impression of all made upon him was
the revelation of the weight of the load that had been put upon the
company by the purchase and construction of the longer branch lines
in Montana and Washington, which he then discovered for the first
time. There was the Missoula branch to the Cœur d’Alene mines; the
Cœur d’Alene Railway &amp; Navigation, a mixed system of steamboats and
rail lines; the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern; and the roads built
into Westernmost Washington; representing a total<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span> investment in
cash and bonds of not far from $30,000,000, which together hardly
earned operating expenses. The acquisition and building of these
disappointing lines had in a few years absorbed the large amount of
consolidated bonds set aside for construction purposes, which had
been assumed to be sufficient for all needs in that direction for a
long time.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> No man should have known the real profitableness of
these extensions better than Mr. Villard; and the circumstances of
his account give it special weight. The admitted fact that in several
cases the managers of the Northern Pacific voted as directors of that
corporation to buy property from themselves as whole or part owners
in other enterprises also excites distrust, and this feeling is
strengthened by the unsatisfactory financial condition in 1893 of the
Northern Pacific system as a whole.</p>

<p>Even before the report of the investigating committee the directors
had been busy with the floating debt. This amounted to $9,918,000
late in 1892, according to the treasurer’s statement. In February,
1893, it was decided to cancel it by the sale of the stock of the
St. Paul &amp; Northern Pacific held in the treasury, but this aroused
violent opposition. The St. Paul &amp; Northern Pacific ran, it will
be remembered, from Brainerd to St. Paul and Minneapolis, and had
formed the eastern terminus of the Northern Pacific system until the
acquisition of the Wisconsin Central. It was justly considered an
extremely important section of the main line, and the possible loss
of its control was regarded as disastrous.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> Dissuaded from their
first purpose, the directors considered the issue of a collateral
mortgage sufficient in amount to relieve all pressing necessities,
and proposed to utilize in this way treasury securities which it
would have been unwise to sell. At the same time the stockholders’
committee had much the same idea in mind, and wrote to President
Oakes in March, and again in May. “Referring to my letter to you of
March 15,” said Brayton Ives, “I beg to say that the financial plan
therein referred to contemplates the creation of a collateral trust
in which shall be placed $10,000,000 Northern Pacific consolidated
5s, $3,000,000 Chicago &amp; Northern Pacific firsts, and all of the
St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span> Paul &amp; Northern Pacific stock belonging to the Northern Pacific
Company, estimated at $7,000,000. Against these securities it is
suggested that notes to the extent of $12,000,000 be issued, bearing
6 per cent interest, and payable in five years, or before, at the
pleasure of the company, provision being made at the same time
for the increase of the amount of the notes to $15,000,000 on the
deposit of additional collateral securities satisfactory to the
underwriters. I am happy to be able to repeat the belief already
expressed, that if the board of directors will allow the underwriters
to name seven directors of the company the entire amount of notes
will be subscribed for without delay.”<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> This plan was backed by
responsible houses, including the Mercantile Trust Company, Kuhn,
Loeb &amp; Co., the Equitable Life Assurance Company, and others, who
agreed to take $7,000,000 of the new bonds at 95, less 1½ per cent
commission. The directors paid no attention to Mr. Ives’s letter, and
his offer was subsequently withdrawn.</p>

<p>The directors’ own scheme was dated May 1, 1893. It provided
for a collateral five-year 6 per cent mortgage to the amount of
$15,000,000, of which $12,000,000 were to be issued at once. There
was to be a committee of five which should take charge of the issue,
and which might sell the collateral before the maturity of the
notes at certain minimum prices or over. Until all the notes should
have been paid the railroad company agreed not to undertake the
construction of any new lines without the consent of the committee,
or to purchase or lease any railroad or navigation lines, or to
guarantee, endorse, or purchase the bonds or other obligations or
stocks of other companies. The committee was to have the voting
power on the underlying stocks, and might direct the trust company
to waive any default of the railroad company in payment of interest.
The railroad company might call in the notes before maturity, after
May 1, 1896, and pay them off at par and accrued interest.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> This,
it will be seen, did not differ in essence from the scheme proposed
by Mr. Ives:—the real contest was between parties and not between
plans. In June, Mr. Villard resigned his position as director and
chairman of the board, and J. D. Rockefeller was elected a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span> director.
Somewhat earlier, but doubtless in anticipation of this action, a
syndicate agreed to underwrite the collateral issue, subject to the
stockholders’ right of subscription;<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> and by the end of the year
$10,275,000 of the collateral notes were outstanding, of which the
bulk had been taken by the syndicate.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> The whole device was very
similar to that employed by the Union Pacific in 1891. It was not
designed as a permanent remedy for anything, but served to postpone
a reckoning to what was hoped would be better times. As a matter of
fact its effect was very small.</p>

<p>Receivers for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company were appointed
August 15, 1893, on a petition alleging that the company was
insolvent and had no funds to meet payments coming due on September
1, October 1, November 1, and December 1. The company in its answer
admitted the facts, and the United States Circuit Court at Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, put Messrs. Henry C. Payne, Thomas F. Oakes, and Henry C.
Rouse in charge of its affairs.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> Receivers were rapidly appointed
for most of the branch lines, the intent being to put all these
properties in separate hands.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> The receivers of the main line
had nothing to do with the branches, although in November they were
authorized to enter into temporary traffic agreements with them. In
regard to the Wisconsin Central, application was early made to compel
the Northern Pacific to carry out the provisions of the lease; but
Judge Jenkins of the Milwaukee court granted the receivers until
September 15 to decide whether or not they desired to continue,
and upon their negative reply authorized a surrender. The accounts
submitted, he said, showed that since the lease had gone into effect
the Chicago &amp; Northern Pacific had been operated at a loss to the
Northern Pacific of $1,304,169 and the Wisconsin Central at a loss
of $1,142,316; although business during the three years in question
had been generally prosperous. In accordance with the decision the
property was turned over to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span> Wisconsin Company on September
26, 1893, and the Northern Pacific for a time gave up the idea of
a Chicago terminus. Of the other leases those of the St. Paul &amp;
Northern Pacific and of the Cœur d’Alene Railway &amp; Navigation Company
were at this time approved by the court, and the receivers were
authorized to make the necessary payments.</p>

<p>The failure of the Northern Pacific was the signal for still more
active and bitter personal struggles between opposing factions than
had before occurred. The opposition, led by Brayton Ives and August
Belmont, endeavored to get control of the company through the annual
election on October 19, and to procure the removal of the appointed
receivers. They displayed the greatest bitterness toward Mr. Villard,
and held him responsible for the position in which the company was
placed. Villard’s “remarkable qualities,” wrote Ives, “have been of
advantage only to himself.... The syndicate composed of Villard,
Colby, Abbott, and Hoyt, and their friends made millions [by the
Wisconsin Central deal] and the Northern Pacific has suffered and is
suffering a corresponding loss.”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> Circulars were sent out asking
proxies, and August Belmont, J. Horace Harding, Brayton Ives, Donald
Mackay, and Winthrop Smith were appointed a committee to receive
proxies as they came in. On the other side the directors appealed to
the stockholders, reminded them that though the company had failed
while they were in office it was also during their term that it
had reached its greatest prosperity, and took the cautious step of
amending the by-laws so as to shorten the term of future boards from
three years to one. Conditions were against the management, and the
result of the election was a complete victory for the Belmont-Ives
party, which was followed up by the choice of Mr. Ives for president.
The real results were less than might be supposed, for the operation
of the railroad and the control of its funds were to be in the hands
of the receivers and not in those of the officers of the road. On
January 20 President Ives filed a petition in the Milwaukee Federal
Court for an order directing the receivers to surrender the seal,
books and papers and stock certificates, and to pay over sufficient
money to enable the president to rent rooms and pay the salaries of
the auditor, secretary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span> and treasurer.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> The petition was denied,
and the elected officers were left in an anomalous position.</p>

<p>In other matters the opposition lost no time in appealing to the
courts. Previous even to the election two actions had been begun
against Henry Villard: the one in September by John Swope of
Philadelphia to compel Henry Villard and others to restore stock and
bonds obtained as a result of an illegal conspiracy:<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> the other
a petition in October by the Northern Pacific Company to force the
receivers to bring suit against Messrs. Villard, Hoyt, and Colby
to recover nearly $2,600,000 alleged to have been made unlawfully
through Northern Pacific deals.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> The complaints were in the
main the same as those which had been made by the investigating
committee, and charged, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">inter alia</i>, that Villard had secured a
profit to himself by bringing about the purchase of the Chicago
terminal properties by the Northern Pacific. Mr. Villard swore
that his whole interest in the transaction had been as officer and
stockholder and securityholder of the Northern Pacific Company,<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a>
and the receivers professed themselves ready and willing to bring
suit, provided they were furnished with the information and evidence
wherewith to prosecute the same.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> The Court reserved the Ives
motion for further consideration, and the following year directed
the receivers to bring suit; but the litigation was eventually
dropped.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a></p>

<p>In December, 1893, the Ives faction filed a petition for the removal
of the receivers. The charges were in part similar to those of the
Swope suit. It was asserted that at the time the receivers were
appointed the road had practically had no hearing; that its managers
had in less than a year burdened it with the interest of $60,000,000
for properties which were of no value to it, but in many of which
they were personally interested and out of which they made large
profits, and that when insolvency was produced by this fraud they
had put the road in the hands of receivers nominated by them for the
purpose, with the effect of perpetuating the same control which had
brought the bankruptcy. Specific charges were made against Oakes,
Villard, and Roswell C. Rolston, president of the Farmers’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span> Loan
&amp; Trust Company; no charges were made against Receivers Payne and
Rouse, but their removal was asked for because they happened to
be in the company of and presumably in the interest of Mr. Oakes.
Besides this, finally, it was alleged that separate receivers had
been unnecessarily appointed for branch lines, and that the expense
of administering the affairs of the company had been enormously
increased.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> The receivers filed lengthy answers on February 3;
Receiver Oakes in particular answering every charge specifically,
filing exhaustive documents in proof, and maintaining in general
the value of the branch properties and his innocence of unlawful
profits.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> The court on the whole inclined to his view. On April
14 Judge Jenkins handed down his decision, dismissing the petition
for the removal of Messrs. Payne and Rouse, and holding Mr. Oakes’s
conduct to have been above investigation except in three instances,
to examine which a master was appointed.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> In the course of his
decision Judge Jenkins concluded that the branch lines in question,
though unprofitable for a while, were necessary to the system; and
that in particular the branches in Washington, Oregon, Montana,
and Idaho were built as feeders, and owing to the sparsely settled
district were necessarily built for the future. If Mr. Oakes were
to be removed on these charges, said he, then it would make the
entire board of directors of the company at that time liable to
impeachment.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> Mr. Cary, the master, reported that Mr. Oakes had
had no pecuniary interest and no personal advantage or gain from any
of the matters referred to him for investigation. Mr. Villard was
said to have made unlawful gains in the acquisition of the Northern
Pacific &amp; Manitoba Company to the extent of $363,494, but Mr. Oakes
did not know that Mr. Villard was so interested, and was not bound to
take notice to prevent such gains.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> In consequence, Judge Jenkins
in October granted a motion to dismiss the petition for the removal
of Oakes as receiver,<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> and the incident was closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
It thus appears that Mr. Ives and his friends obtained but little
satisfaction in the courts up to this point. They were unable to
force the receivers to turn over any share of the Northern Pacific’s
earnings, and they were equally unable to remove the receivers from
office. So long as the road should remain in the receivers’ hands
their authority seemed destined to be nominal, and they were thus
spurred on by their own private interests to make some attempt at
reorganization. At the same time their opponents, as bondholders,
were not unwilling to receive some interest on their bonds, and
succeeded in this, as in other matters, in drawing substantial
control into their own hands. The year 1894 was a bad one and made
the importance of a reduction in fixed charges loom large. Passenger
earnings decreased from $5,917,054 to $3,960,772, and freight
earnings from $17,017,630 to $11,418,692; while in spite of attempted
economies by the receivers, net earnings decreased by almost the same
absolute amount.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> Cuts in wages were inevitable, and a serious
strike aggravated the situation. It became necessary to borrow money
from the Adams Reorganization Committee, of which more will be said
later, and to issue $5,000,000 in receivers’ certificates to pay
off $5,000,000 already authorized in 1893. On September 8 formal
announcement was made that the receiverships of the twenty-four
branch lines of the Northern Pacific system were to be terminated,
and that the trustee was to undertake the legal management of all
the lines for a stated sum per annum; while the general receivers,
Messrs. Oakes, Rouse, and Payne, were to operate the separated lines
under a fair traffic agreement. It was figured that $64,000 per
annum would be saved; and further economies were made in the cost of
the administrative staff at New York. The relief was insufficient.
Net earnings for 1894 were $5,506,007, and fixed charges were
$12,004,985, and the need of a reorganization was impressively shown.</p>

<p>The work of devising a reorganization plan was done in the various
bondholders’ committees. Late in 1893 a committee of consolidated 5
per cent bondholders had been formed, with E. D. Adams as chairman
and General Louis Fitzgerald as vice-chairman; which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span> declared itself
to be independent, but was regarded as affiliated with the former
managers of the road. In March, 1894, this committee announced that,
having received responses from the holders of a majority of the
consolidated bonds, it had prepared an agreement and had secured its
acceptance by the German bondholders. All consolidated bondholders
were requested to deposit their securities with the Mercantile Trust
Company, which would issue engraved certificates of deposit, which
the committee would endeavor to have listed on the Stock Exchange.
Mr. Ives was opposed to any step toward reorganization of this sort,
and objected particularly to the composition of the committee; he
therefore asked bondholders to withhold their acceptance of the
agreement, and gave various reasons to lend weight to his request.
In April, as a counter-move, he invited bondholders to send in
their names and addresses to him, together with the amount of their
holdings, saying that this action would not commit the bondholders,
and was desired only to enable the company to furnish information
respecting its affairs, and, when the proper time should arise, to
confer about a reorganization plan. The rapid falling off in earnings
soon imperilled the interest of the second and third mortgage bonds,
superior to the consolidated mortgage. In July the Adams Committee
appealed to the holders of these issues, and secured a considerable
number of deposits. Henceforth it planned to act as a general
reorganization committee. On the other hand a committee headed by
Johnston Livingston competed for deposits of the second mortgage, and
one headed by C. B. Van Nostrand for deposits of the third mortgage
bonds. It was urged that holders of the earlier issues should not
deposit with the consolidated committee, because its interest lay in
cutting down prior liens; whereas the Van Nostrand Committee declared
that the road could earn the interest on the third mortgage, and that
these bonds should not accept less than par and interest in cash.
Nevertheless the Deutsche Bank’s London agency announced in September
that it was prepared to receive second mortgage, third mortgage, and
consolidated bonds on behalf of the Adams Committee, and to forward
the same to New York for deposit. Various rumors were afloat at
this time concerning reorganization, and suggestions were made for
converting the third mortgage bonds into 5 per cent income bonds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span> and
the consolidated bonds into preferred stock;<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> but the only result
was to stir up protests from the third mortgage bondholders, who
still insisted in August that earnings were more than sufficient to
pay the interest on all prior liens. Late in the year there was talk
of selling the road under foreclosure of the second mortgage, but
this too came to nothing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the operation of the road went on. Receiver Rouse reported
on the condition of the property in January, 1894. He estimated
that $10,000,000 would be required to bring the permanent way into
the most effective condition for economical operation. Exceptional
causes, said he, had contributed to make the earnings for the
previous three years exceptionally large, and this fact, together
with the prevailing depression, the competition of the Great
Northern, and reduced rates, would decrease the gross earnings in the
immediate future at least 27 per cent. Although Mr. Rouse believed
in the value of the Northern Pacific’s branch lines, his report was
not encouraging.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> In September, on the approach of the annual
election, President Ives issued a long circular. The serious decrease
in the earnings of the road, he said, had affected for the worse the
position of the stockholders, and these holders should understand
that no one of the reorganization committees was working for their
interest. He announced the appointment of a committee to receive
proxies, and revealed the embarrassment of the management by a
request for contributions of $12.50 per hundred shares in order to
pay the expenses of the officers. So far as the officers should have
any voice in the matter, President Ives assured the stockholders,
contributions should be credited on any assessments which might be
made thereafter. On the day of the election no opposing ticket was
presented, and the Ives party were reëlected to their positions. This
is where matters stood at the beginning of 1895. The hostility of the
opposing committees was in no way abated; but the Adams Committee
had secured deposits of nearly $21,000,000 of the consolidated
mortgage bonds, $1,000,000 more than a majority of the third mortgage
bonds,<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> and $3,000,000 less than a majority of the second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
mortgage bonds, and with the hearty support of the Deutsche Bank was
steadily strengthening its position.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></p>

<p>In May, 1895, the Adams Committee reorganization plan came out and
marked the first serious suggestion for a rehabilitation of the
property. It proposed a sale, under foreclosure, of the old company
and the formation of a new company under special arrangements for
this purpose. The new company was to issue $100,000,000 in shares,
and a maximum of $200,000,000 in gold bonds free from taxation,
secured by a mortgage lien on the whole Northern Pacific system,
including the St. Paul &amp; Northern Pacific Railway, and bearing
interest partly at 4 per cent and partly at 3 per cent, all under the
same mortgage. A sufficient amount of these bonds was to be reserved
to replace the existing first mortgage, besides a further amount to
acquire independent branch lines or for new construction at a maximum
charge of $20,000 per mile. The principal and interest of the new
bonds were to be guaranteed unconditionally by the Great Northern
Road, in return for which the Great Northern was to receive one-half
of the stock of the new company. The new board was to consist of nine
directors, of whom four were to be nominated by the Northern Pacific
Reorganization Committee. Each $1000 Northern Pacific second mortgage
bond was to receive a $1125 new Northern Pacific guaranteed bond;
each $1000 third mortgage bond a new $1000 3 per cent guaranteed
bond, and at least $250 in shares; each $1000 5 per cent consol at
least $500 in new 3 per cent guaranteed bonds and $300 in shares.
Overdue coupons of the second mortgage were to be paid in cash at the
rate of 5 per cent annually, those of the third mortgage at 4 per
cent, and those of the consols to be adjusted at the rate of 2½ per
cent in new 3 per cent bonds. The floating debt of the receivership
was to be paid by an assessment of about $11,000,000 on the old
stock. The reorganization and the raising of the necessary working
capital were to be secured by a syndicate headed by J. P. Morgan &amp;
Company and the Deutsche Bank.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Briefly stated, this plan proposed to decrease somewhat the funded
debt, while reducing also the interest rate from 6 and 5 to 4 and 3
per cent. The reduction in fixed charges which would have ensued it
is impossible to estimate without further details. The amount which
bondholders were asked to give up was, however, considerable, and
for this compensation was variously given in new bonds and in new
stock. The floating debt was not to be funded, but was to be paid
off by the commendable method of an assessment; and provision was
made for working capital, although at what cost in profits to the
syndicate was not stated. But more important than the details of
the plan was the guarantee of the new issues by the Great Northern
Company for which it provided. The question of consolidation between
the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern was said, on what
purported to be good authority, to have originated on the side of
the Northern Pacific among men to whom an alliance seemed necessary
to the prosperity of the latter road.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> Mr. Hill was said to have
been at first reluctant, and to have consented only on condition
that a majority of the Northern Pacific stock should be placed
within his hands. It can scarcely be supposed, however, that he did
not welcome such a union; and the petition of the Northern Pacific
receivers for the cancellation of contracts with the Great Northern
and the Minneapolis Union railway companies<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> made consolidation
especially desirable at this time. To the end of this consolidation
the Adams Committee plan was chiefly framed, and on its execution
the adequacy of the plan depended. If the Great Northern could have
been induced to guarantee the principal and interest of the new
Northern Pacific bonds the likelihood of a default would have been
reduced to a minimum, even on the indebtedness outstanding before
the receivership; and a scheme for paying the floating debt and for
providing a certain amount of new capital would have been all that
would have been required. But it is clear that a proposal for a
consolidation of two of the principal lines serving the Northwest
brought the consuming and producing public to an interest in the
Northern Pacific reorganization which they had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span> felt before.
So long as a reorganization plan dealt merely with exchanges and
manipulation of securities by and among securityholders, the
influence of any settlement on outsiders was very indirect; but
when it operated to reduce competition in a large section of the
country the effect was plain and striking. Certain conservative
financiers suggested a holding company to hold the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific stock, in order to throw some sort of a veil
over the proceedings, but Mr. Hill would not consent.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> Late in
August, 1895, therefore, a bill in equity was filed to prevent the
proposed coöperation, and on September 17 Attorney-General Childs,
for the state of Minnesota, brought suit for an injunction on the
ground that the combination was contrary to the laws of the state and
would prevent competition. It was said that Mr. Childs was supported
by the practically unanimous sentiment of the people of Washington
and Montana. The matter came before the Supreme Court on suit by one
Pearsall, a stockholder of the Great Northern, and this tribunal
held that the combination was contrary to the laws of Minnesota
and should, therefore, be enjoined, affirming the principle for
which Mr. Childs contended.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> This settled the fate of the Adams
reorganization plan; and an entirely new scheme had to be devised.</p>

<p>But while once more progress toward reorganization seemed to have
ceased, sensational developments occurred in the factional conflicts
to which we have already referred. To Mr. Ives, barred from all
participation in the management of the road, denied a salary, and
unable to obtain the removal of the receivers by Judge Jenkins, came
the idea of appealing to another court. It will be remembered that,
the original receivership suit had been instituted in the circuit
court of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and that that court ever since had
been regarded as possessing primary jurisdiction. Since no compulsion
existed on other courts to recognize this jurisdiction of the
Milwaukee court, the orders of which were supreme in its own district
only, and the smooth working of the receivership was due to a respect
for “comity,” it was possible, as Ives well knew, for any circuit
court along the line to throw existing arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span> into the direst
confusion. Relying on this fact, President Ives sent the General
Counsel of the company to present applications for the removal of
the receivers to one court after the other along the road.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> In
September, 1895, judges willing to take jurisdiction were found in
Seattle, in the far northwestern corner of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a>
Petition was made in two parts: first, that the Seattle court take
jurisdiction; second, that it remove Messrs. Oakes, Rouse, and Payne.
Judge Hanford of the Federal Court of the Washington District called
Judge Gilbert of the United States Circuit Court to sit with him,
and deciding on the question of jurisdiction first, according to the
request of the receivers, the two judges held that the principle
of comity did not of necessity apply in the Northern Pacific case
because no part of the railroad was within the jurisdiction of Judge
Jenkins’s court, and any court along the road could more properly and
efficiently administer the trust. The court, therefore, directed the
receivers to answer the charges of malfeasance, and to file their
answers in Seattle by October 2; also to file their accounts with
the clerk of the court at Seattle,<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> and to file each a $100,000
bond.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a></p>

<p>The result was the prompt resignation of the receivers, who in a
letter to Judge Jenkins made their feelings clear. “Your receivers
manifestly cannot administer the trust,” said they, “with justice
to the parties interested, or themselves, if subject to the orders
and instructions as to the general administration from two or more
independent tribunals. We cannot abide, nor can we ask our sureties
to abide, the danger of the differences of opinion between courts,
each assuming to be controlling as to the expenditures of the
receivership in the general administration, in view of the immensity
of the interests involved.... Unless your receivers recognize, as
they understand it, that that honorable court [the Seattle court]
is the court of primary jurisdiction they will of necessity be in
contumacy.... Your receivers are not willing under any circumstances
to file an additional bond in such jurisdiction, nor are they
willing to put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span> themselves in a position to endanger their right
to challenge the jurisdiction of that honorable court.”<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> Judge
Jenkins accepted the resignations and appointed Messrs. McHenry,
chief engineer of the Northern Pacific, and Bigelow, a Milwaukee
banker, receivers.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> The hitherto respected principle of comity
had, however, lost all force. On September 30 Judge Sanborn at
St. Paul confirmed Judge Jenkins’s appointments for the states of
Minnesota and North Dakota; on October 1 Judge Hanford at Tacoma
refused to accept the resignation of the old receivers, but removed
them and appointed Andrew F. Burleigh for the district of Washington;
on October 2 Judge Billinger concurred in Burleigh’s appointment for
Oregon; on October 7 Judge Knowles at Helena, Montana, confirmed
the above for the districts of Washington and Oregon, and appointed
Captain J. H. Mills and E. L. Bonner for the district of Montana;
and in the week ending October 26 Judge Beatty appointed Burleigh
receiver for Idaho. The only conservative action was that of Judge
Lacombe in New York, who deferred his appointments as often as the
matter came before him, in the hope that the Western judges would
come to an agreement.</p>

<p>The situation at the end of October, 1895, was as follows: in
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North Dakota there were two receivers,
Messrs. McHenry and Bigelow; in Montana there were three receivers,
Messrs. Mills, Bonner, and Burleigh; and in Idaho, Washington, and
Oregon there was one receiver, Andrew F. Burleigh. It was a condition
of affairs which could not be endured. In each of the Western States
orders were made compelling all agents or persons connected with the
road to deposit all money collected in that state, and it was at any
time in the power of the receivers in any state to appoint operating
officers distinct from those managing traffic over the other parts of
the line. On January 9, 1896, Judge Gilbert simplified the situation
by retiring Messrs. Mills and Bonner, and by appointing Andrew F.
Burleigh sole receiver for the district of Montana. This reduced the
number of receivers to three, and left Burleigh in control of the
road west of North Dakota, and McHenry and Bigelow in control of the
rest. Application was now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span> made to the Supreme Court of the United
States, and on January 28, 1896, four justices of this tribunal,
acting as justices assigned to the several districts in which the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company had property,<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> decided that
Judge Jenkins’s court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin should
be considered the court of primary jurisdiction, and issued each an
order to this effect to take effect in his particular circuit.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a>
The various circuit judges hastened to conform. On February 21 Judge
Lacombe confirmed the appointment of F. G. Bigelow and E. H. McHenry
as receivers for the Second Judicial District, and similar action
had by then been taken by the judges of the other districts except
that of the state of Washington. There Judges Gilbert and Hanford
refused to discharge Burleigh, although recognizing that the general
orders for the management and control of the railroad property were
henceforth to issue from Judge Jenkins’s court.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> The judicial
strife was thus at an end. President Ives obtained the removal of the
receivers to whom he particularly objected, but did not overthrow the
authority of the Milwaukee court, nor secure any material gain to
compensate for the great trouble which he caused.</p>

<p>With the receivership tangle straightened out it became possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
to proceed again with the work of reorganization, and on March 16,
1896, the final plan was published, endorsed not only by the Adams
Committee, but by President Ives and his Stockholders’ Protective
Committee, and by other important interests as well. The feeling had
become general that some action should speedily be taken, and that
it was in the interest of all parties that the factional conflicts
which had raged so long and with so little result should cease.
Reorganization was proposed on the following basis:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The abandonment of Chicago as the eastern terminus, and the
limitation of the railway on the east by the Mississippi River and
the Great Lakes;—the bonds and stocks of the Chicago &amp; Northern
Pacific and of the Chicago &amp; Calumet Companies to be sold.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The ultimate union of the main line, branches, and terminal
properties through direct ownership by a single company.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The reduction of the fixed annual charges to less than the
minimum earnings under probable conditions.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Ample provision for additional capital as required in a series
of years for the development of the property and for the greater
facilities necessitated by an increased business.</p>

<p>There were to be issued:</p>

<p>$130,000,000 in prior lien 100-year 4 per cent gold bonds, to be
secured by a mortgage upon the main line, branches, terminals, land
grant, equipment, and other property embraced in the reorganization
... and ... thereafter acquired.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a></p>

<p>$190,000,000 in general lien 150-year 3 per cent gold bonds, with a
lien junior to the previous issue, but covering the same property,
of which $130,000,000 were to be reserved to retire the $130,000,000
prior lien bonds when they should fall due.</p>

<p>$70,000,000 in 4 per cent non-cumulative preferred stock.</p>

<p>$80,000,000 in common stock.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the new prior liens were to go for old first and
second mortgage bonds, receivers, certificates, equipment trusts,
collateral trust notes, St. Paul &amp; Northern Pacific bonds, and for
new construction; the new general liens for mortgages junior to the
second mortgage; the new preferred stock as additional inducement to
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span> exchanges mentioned above, and in part for the retirement of
old preferred stock; and the common stock for old preferred stock
(in part) and common stock. Existing first mortgage bondholders were
not, however, to be forced to give up their old securities. “It is
not sought in any way to enforce a conversion of the present general
first mortgage bonds,” said the plan, “and this offer is made solely
on the belief that on the terms proposed such conversion, while
advantageous to the company, is also manifestly to the advantage of
the bondholders so converting.” There were reserved $4,000,000 of
the general liens for new construction, and $2,500,000 new preferred
and an equal amount of common were set aside under the general head
“to provide for reorganization purposes or available as a treasury
asset.” None of the new bonds were to be subject to drawing or to
compulsory redemption prior to their regular maturity. The proceeds
from land sales to an amount not exceeding $500,000 in any year were
to be devoted to the redemption by purchase and cancellation of the
new bonds, purchases to be made of prior liens so long as these could
be secured at not over 110, after which to continue of the securities
next in rank. The preferred stock was to have a claim for 4 per
cent before anything should be paid on the common stock, and was to
participate equally with the common after 4 per cent had been paid on
each. There was to be a voting trust until November 1, 1901, unless
closed out earlier by the voting trustees, after the expiration of
which the preferred stock was to have the right to elect a majority
of the board of directors whenever for two successive years 4 per
cent dividends on their holdings should not have been paid. No
additional mortgage was to be put upon the property, and the amount
of preferred stock was not to be increased, except, in each instance,
after obtaining the consent of a majority of the whole amount of the
preferred stock, given at a meeting of the stockholders called for
that purpose, and the consent of a majority of such common stock as
should be represented at such meeting, the holders of each class of
stock voting separately. During the existence of the voting trust
the consent of holders of like amounts of the respective classes
of beneficial certificates was to be necessary. There was to be an
assessment of $10 on preferred stock and of $15 on common. Branch
lines were to be consolidated with the main line, but each case was
to be dealt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span> with separately, and a fair basis of adjustment arrived
at, for which general lien 3 per cents and new preferred stock were
reserved. There was to be an underwriting syndicate, formed by J. P.
Morgan &amp; Company, and the Deutsche Bank of Berlin, to the subscribed
amount of $45,000,000, to provide amounts of cash estimated to be
necessary to carry out the terms of the plan, and to furnish the
new company with some $5,000,000 working capital for early use
in betterments and enlargements of its property. The syndicate’s
compensation was not stated in the plan, but was to be “reasonable,”
and in addition to it the sum of ¼ per cent of the par value of all
securities deposited was to be paid to J. P. Morgan &amp; Company and
the Deutsche Bank for their respective services as managers and
depositaries. Finally, at the discretion of the managers, the various
properties were to be sold under one of the several mortgages in
default, and a successor company was to be organized.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a></p>

<p>An examination of this plan shows that the total capitalization
proposed, exclusive of bonds and stock reserved for new construction,
etc., amounted to $311,000,000; of which $161,000,000 were 4 per
cent and 3 per cent bonds and $150,000,000 stock. The reported
capitalization of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1893 had been
$218,685,631, including the bonds of branch roads guaranteed; but
comparison of this figure with that given by the plan is not fair,
because in 1893 the Northern Pacific property had been owned by
fifty-four distinct corporations, which the reorganization proposed
to consolidate into one. A comparison of the total bonds and
stock issued by the fifty-four corporations with the issue under
the reorganization plan reveals an increase from $271,949,044 to
$311,000,000, or 14.3 per cent. At the same time fixed charges
were to be decreased, according to estimates, from $10,509,690 to
$6,052,660; to cover which the managers reported net earnings of
$6,015,846 for the year ending June 30, 1895, and of $7,801,645
for the average of the five years ending with that date. It will
be observed, therefore, that the plan left no margin between net
earnings in 1895 and fixed charges, but relied upon an increase in
earnings for the future to preserve the solvency of the road. It
is, however, only just to say that the net<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span> earnings in 1895 were
less than they had been in any year since 1887, with the exception
of 1894, and that a considerable increase was probable. The large
reduction in fixed charges which was to take place was to be chiefly
at the expense of holders of the consolidated mortgage bonds of
1889. These unfortunate investors received but 129 per cent in new
securities, of which nearly one-half was stock, in return for a
reduction in their fixed annual income from 5 to 2 per cent, the
reason being the inferior character of their mortgage lien. That
securityholders who had consented to exchange their prior securities
in 1889 for the consols then issued in the hope of benefiting the
road should have fared considerably worse than bondholders who had
refused to make concessions is an example of the injustice sometimes
occasioned by successive reorganizations and refundings. Of the
other securities the second mortgage received prior liens and stock
sufficient to bring its return over 6 per cent, providing the road
should earn it, and the third mortgage and dividend certificates
received general liens and stock sufficient to yield something over
5 per cent except in very prosperous times, when their income would
be larger. The underlying principle in these cases was the union of
a security with a fixed claim on earnings with a security with a
conditional claim only. The first mortgage received no stock, and so
was denied participation in future profits, but in recompense gave up
only some .6 per cent in the annual income received. The collateral
trust notes fared nearly as badly as the consolidated mortgage,
but the northwest equipment stock was paid off in cash. In brief,
all securities but the equipment stock yielded something, and the
greatest sacrifices were demanded from the junior securities. On the
other hand, the stock was far from escaping unscathed. On January 2,
1896, the quoted prices were 3½ for common and 12⅝ for preferred. As
against this the plan made assessments of $15 on common and $10 on
preferred;—sums which could obviously be demanded only because of
the probable future appreciation of the shares. A point in favor of
the stock was the fact that the reduction in fixed charges brought
it nearer a dividend; although it must be remembered that the common
stock had to divide any return above 4 per cent with the preferred.</p>

<p>The other salient points of the plan were the provision for paying
the floating debt, for supplying fresh capital for future additions
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span> improvements, for consolidation of branch lines with the
main stem, and for a voting trust. The total floating debt in
1895 amounted to over $20,000,000, of which $4,900,000 consisted
of outstanding receivers’ certificates and $8,329,205 of interest
matured and unpaid.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> The unpaid interest was provided for in
the exchanges which have already been described; the receivers’
certificates were cancelled by prior lien bonds, and the balance
was provided for by assessment. This method was a sound one. The
provision for new construction, betterments, etc., was liberal,
consisting of $25,000,000 prior lien bonds, of which no more than
$1,500,000 were to be issued in any year, and $4,000,000 general lien
bonds, presumably to be used as needed. One of the great difficulties
in the history of the company had been the lack of necessary
capital for needed work upon the line, and it was well that future
requirements were provided for. The consolidation of the branch lines
into the parent company was also wise. “As it [the Northern Pacific
system] now stands,” the committee said, “the system, in its form of
incorporation and capitalization, is a development without method
or adequate preparation for growth. Scarcely any single security is
complete in itself. The main line mortgages cover neither feeders
nor terminals. The terminal mortgages may be bereft of their main
line support. The branch lines are dependent on the main line for
interchange of business and the main line owes a large part of its
business to the branch lines.”<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> The plan contemplated separate
bargains with each branch. Negotiations were carried on during
1896, and some of the arrangements arrived at were as follows: The
bondholders of the Northern Pacific &amp; Manitoba Terminal and of
the James River Valley Railroad agreed to take 50 per cent in new
Northern Pacific 3 per cent bonds and 50 per cent in preferred stock,
and to allow the Northern Pacific to retain their property.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a>
Bondholders of the Duluth &amp; Manitoba were given 90 per cent in
cash.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> Bondholders of the Spokane &amp; Palouse received 52½ per
cent cash, 52½ per cent in general 3s, and 25 per cent in Northern
Pacific preferred stock,<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> and Helena &amp; Red Mountain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span> bondholders
agreed to accept 100 per cent in new preferred.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> A number of
the branches were foreclosed and bought in by the Northern Pacific
reorganization committee, and the net result was an exceedingly
beneficial unification of the system. Finally, the voting trust was
designed to secure permanence in policy during the first years of
the new company’s existence. The idea has been a common, and on the
whole a wise one. In this case the membership represented fairly the
interests which had been prominent throughout the receivership, and
consisted of J. P. Morgan, George Siemans, representing the Deutsche
Bank, August Belmont, Johnston Livingston, and Charles Lanier. The
trustees were to fill their own vacancies, except that the successors
of George Siemans were always to be nominated by the Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>In the main the plan was a good one, following a sound principle,
and reducing fixed charges to a point which, if not far below the
danger-line, proved low enough in view of the subsequent development
in business. Current opinion was generally favorable, and criticised
only the amount of profits which the syndicate was to secure on the
basis of its large subscribed capital. Mr. Hill of the Great Northern
said: “I think the Northern Pacific reorganization plan will be
successful. The promoters have adopted a conservative policy, and
have marked the interest charges down. We are entirely satisfied
to have the Northern Pacific securityholders run the road, pay its
debts, and be charged with the responsibility of meeting all its
proper obligations, rather than to have it operated by the officers
of two or three courts which are continually contending as to
jurisdiction.”<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> By April 23, when the time for deposits expired,
the reorganization committee was able to announce that it held over
92½ per cent in amount of general, second, and third mortgage bonds,
dividend certificates, consolidated mortgage bonds, collateral trust
notes, preferred stock, common stock, northwest equipment stock,
and Northern Pacific and Montana first mortgage bonds, and that the
plan and agreement was therefore declared operative.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> By June a
majority of the first mortgage bonds had been secured, and it was
announced that after June 30 the basis of conversion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span> of this issue
would be reduced from 135 to 132 per cent in new 4 per cent prior
lien bonds. On July 24 the Northern Pacific <em>Railway</em> filed its
articles of incorporation at St. Paul, Minnesota, and the next day
the sale of the property took place, in spite of suits by the general
creditors and the preferred stockholders. The sale was in three
parcels, and the property was bid in for $12,500,000 by Mr. Winter,
the newly elected president. After the first sale the company’s lands
in Wisconsin were offered and bid in for $575,000, and two days later
the lands west of the Missouri were bought in for sums aggregating
$600,000. Finally, on August 4, the lands in Washington and Oregon
were bought in for $1,705,200 and $558,000 respectively. The property
of the company was turned over by the receivers to the reorganization
committee at midnight, August 31, and on November 7 the final step in
the reorganization plan was taken by the formal authorization by the
stockholders of the issue of $190,000,000 of bonds.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a></p>

<p>From 1896 to the present time the Northern Pacific has enjoyed a
development scarcely less noteworthy than that of the Union Pacific.
Gross earnings have increased from $23,679,718 in 1898, the first
full year after the receivership, to $68,534,832 in 1907; net revenue
from $13,471,544 to $33,208,840; and mileage from 4350 to 5444. Gross
earnings per mile were $5443 in 1898; they were $12,590 in 1907. The
retirement of the eastern terminus of the system from Chicago to
St. Paul and Minneapolis was accomplished in the course of 1897 by
arrangement for connection with the Chicago &amp; Northwestern instead
of with the Wisconsin Central, and the sale of the certificates
of proprietary interest in the Chicago Terminal Transfer Railroad
received by the Northern Pacific under the Chicago &amp; Northern Pacific
plan of reorganization; while the improvement of the position of the
new mortgages has been vigorously prosecuted by the rapid drawing for
redemption of old first mortgage bonds at 110, and by the calling of
the entire issue of the Missouri division bonds at par and accrued
interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
In the years following 1897 large sums have been spent for
betterments and enlargements. Some $68,500,000 have been invested
from the proceeds of the sale of prior lien bonds and of
miscellaneous assets, and over $18,000,000 have been temporarily
withdrawn from income for the same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> Grades have been
reduced, lines straightened, new branches built, real estate
acquired, track relaid and ballasted, bridges strengthened and
renewed, equipment rebuilt and increased in amount, and other similar
betterments undertaken. It is a work which all the great American
systems have carried on, but the Northern Pacific has surpassed
even the Union Pacific in the extent of its operations. Ordinary
maintenance requirements have not meanwhile been neglected, and
in 1906 and 1907 the Northern Pacific set aside $2,000,000 for
depreciation of equipment, which is over and above the other sums
which have been mentioned. The company owned 1255 locomotives on
June 30, 1907, of an average weight of 174,000 pounds; in 1898 it
had owned 542 of an average weight of 104,000 pounds. It had 42,000
freight cars in 1907 with an average capacity of over 33 tons; it
had possessed 18,500 in 1898 of an average capacity of 22 tons.
Seventy-five per cent of the main line was laid with track of 72
pounds or over in 1906, but only thirteen per cent in 1898. In
consequence heavier trains are run,<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> at a less expense per ton,
and the net revenue is correspondingly increased. Even the liberal
expenditures which have hitherto been made are insufficient, however,
for present conditions, and the stockholders have approved a proposal
to issue $93,000,000 of new common stock at par for the purpose of
extending the Northern Pacific’s mileage and facilities.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a></p>

<p>The endeavor to stimulate traffic to fill the trains has led to
important developments. In order to increase the exchange of
commodities between their territory and the Middle West, to establish
stable conditions on transcontinental business and thereby to secure
back loading for their cars, the Great Northern and Northern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
Pacific in 1901 arranged for the purchase of the Burlington system
which connected both their lines with Chicago. The refusal to share
their purchase with Mr. Harriman led to the competitive purchase of
Northern Pacific stock by rival interests, and to the retirement of
the Northern Pacific preferred, but did not prevent the consummation
of the deal.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> This purchase has been a profitable one. The
Burlington has paid in dividends upon its stock almost enough to
cover the interest on the bonds issued to acquire it, and the
indirect effects of its control have satisfied expectations. Indeed,
the east-bound lumber traffic has so developed that the Great
Northern has recently raised its lumber rates in order once more to
equalize east- and west-bound shipments.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific has been openly dominated by the Hill-Morgan
interests for the last six years, and probably has been under their
control since its reorganization. From the financial as well as from
the traffic point of view its position is secure. The voting trust
was dissolved in 1901 “by reason,” in the words of the trustees,
“of the evidence of financial strength, conservative management,
skilful and profitable operation, superior physical condition of the
property, and the reasonable prospect of continued prosperity.”<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a>
In 1907, out of a net income of $33,208,840 only $9,575,183 were paid
out for interest, rentals, and taxes, and $23,473,929 were left for
dividends, improvements, and reserve. This whole sum, which amounts
to 33 per cent of gross income, is available as a protection for the
mortgage bonds; and a considerable portion could be dispensed with
without forcing a decrease in the present rate of dividends.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a>
It is likely that the coming years will see a check in the advance
of national prosperity, but the Northern Pacific is in excellent
condition to stand the strain.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> original Rock Island Railroad, chartered in 1847,<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> was
completed between Chicago and Rock Island in 1854. Construction was
continued from Rock Island to Council Bluffs across the state of
Iowa, under the charter of the Mississippi &amp; Missouri, until 1866,
when this company was merged with the original Rock Island Railroad
Company, and after 1866 under the Rock Island charter until the
extension was completed in 1869. Unlike the Atchison, the Rock Island
passed through a fairly well-settled territory, which was at the
same time one of the most fertile in the United States. In 1870,
according to the census returns, Iowa produced 28,708,312 bushels
of spring wheat out of a total for the United States of 112,549,733
bushels, more than any other state in the Union; while Illinois in
its yield of winter wheat was surpassed by Indiana and Ohio alone. Of
Indian corn Iowa and Illinois together produced 198,856,460 bushels
against 562,088,089 for all other states combined. Manufactures were
well begun, and even mining had attained a considerable development,
particularly in the extraction of bituminous coal in Illinois.
Naturally the road was prosperous; gross earnings increased from
$3,154,236 in 1866 to $5,995,226 in 1870, and to $9,409,833 in 1879;
while net earnings attained the very considerable sum of $4,548,117
in 1879, being 48 per cent of the gross receipts. At the same time
the capitalization was very moderate, due to the relatively level
character of the country through which the road ran, and, not less
important, to the absence of speculative financial operations in the
course of its construction. To build 1231 miles had cost in 1879 but
$35,664,200, of which $4,702,202 had been supplied from earnings;
leaving a total of bonds and stocks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span> $30,962,000, or $25,151 per
mile. Fixed charges were, therefore, low. In 1875, when net earnings
were $3,853,676, interest on bonds, taxes, and all other necessary
disbursements took but $1,065,395; and in 1879 the payments were
markedly less. Is it strange that the troubles of the road came from
too great earnings rather than from too small, and that instead of
striving to maintain solvency the directors had to seek ways and
means for concealing or getting rid of earnings without arousing
the hostility of legislators to whom 10 per cent dividends seemed
high, and anything over 10 per cent proof of extortion? Between
1866 and 1876 four cash distributions of 10 per cent were made to
stockholders, five of 8 per cent, one of 8½ per cent, and one of
7½ per cent. The dividend for 1879 was again 10 per cent, that of
1878 8 per cent, and that for 1879 9½ per cent. Meanwhile large sums
were carried to surplus. The balance, after all disbursements, never
after 1873 fell below $665,000, and in 1879 was nearly equal to the
dividend declared; that is, while distributing $1,993,086, or 9.5 per
cent, the road earned, over and above charges, $3,947,065, or 18.8
per cent.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that some attempt should be made to increase the
distribution to stockholders; and the most obvious method was the one
adopted, viz., a watering of the stock. The plan devised in 1880 was
as follows: It was proposed to consolidate various branches of the
railroad company, hitherto operated as separate corporations, with
the main line; and to do this through the formation of a new company,
which should exchange its stock for the stock of the previously
existing corporations in the ratio of two to one. Practically all
the stock retired was owned by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific
Railroad Company, so that the only increase in stock outstanding came
through the distribution to the stockholders of the parent company.
In March the executive committee of the Rock Island passed the
following resolution: “Resolved, that the proposition to consolidate
the capital stock, property, rights, franchises, and privileges
of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad Company with the
capital stock, property, rights, franchises, and privileges of the
Iowa Southern &amp; Missouri Northern Railroad Company, the Newton
&amp; Monroe Railroad Company, the Avoca, Macedonia &amp; Southwestern
Railroad Company, and the Atlantic &amp; Audubon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span> Railroad Company into
a consolidated Railroad Company, with an authorized capital of
$50,000,000, and such powers as shall be assumed in the articles of
consolidation, be submitted to a vote of the stockholders of this
company at their annual meeting.”<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> Of the roads named only the
Iowa Southern &amp; Missouri Northern was of importance, extending 270
miles from Washington, Iowa, to Leavenworth, with branches which
raised its total to 347 miles. This company had been organized as
the Chicago &amp; Southwestern Railroad Company, and the main line had
been completed in 1871. The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad
Company had guaranteed its $5,000,000 main-line bonds, with a
provision that it could demand foreclosure if called upon to pay
either interest or principal, and in return had secured a lease in
perpetuity. The road had been sold under foreclosure and reorganized
in 1875 as the Iowa Southern &amp; Missouri Northern, and had issued
its stock to the Rock Island in return for money advanced by that
company, the stock to be held in trust to 1926, and then to become
the property of the lessee. The other roads did not together possess
more than 80 miles of line, so that the operation was a genuine case
of stock-watering. The opinion of the stockholders may be inferred
from the quotations of their shares. Between January 2 and June 1,
1880, the quotations of Rock Island common rose from 149 to 189,
with few sales, in anticipation of the distribution. On June 2 the
stockholders formally gave their approval, and on June 4 the Chicago,
Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway started on its career.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> The price
of the new stock was of course less than that of the old. It started
at 106½, but by December it had reached 122¼, and by June the
following year had risen to over 141.</p>

<p>This may be called Rock Island’s first reorganization. It doubled the
stock of the road, and increased its indebtedness by the assumption
of the $5,000,000 bonds of the Iowa Southern &amp; Missouri Northern;
but the new stock involved no increase in fixed charges, and the new
bonds a nominal increase only. Instead of being occasioned by too
little prosperity it was caused by too much; and instead of being
carried through after active opposition from many of the interests
concerned, and reluctant acquiescence from the others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span> it occasioned
a rise in price of the common stock of 27 per cent in six months.</p>

<p>Between this date and 1902 no reorganization occurred. A rapid review
of the period brings out, however, certain interesting features:
First, that the stockholders and the directors were extremely
conservative; second, that this conservatism did not keep the road
from sharing in the expansion of mileage from 1887–9, which was so
general in the Middle West; third, that this expansion decreased the
average receipts per mile, and consequently the rate of dividends,
and occasioned a fall in stock quotations from 140⅞ to 63⅜; fourth,
that though weakened the road went through the panic of 1893 and the
subsequent depression without suspending dividends; and fifth, that
the year 1901 saw the beginning of a new expansion of the system,
accompanied by a change in control and the carrying out of more
ambitious plans than had ever occurred to the men of the previous
generation.</p>

<p>The conservatism of the stockholders is shown in the election, year
after year, of the same men to positions of authority. Rock Island
was not a speculative road; the high price of its stock forbade.
Stockholders regarded their shares as permanent investments, and,
satisfied with the returns secured, loyally supported the management
in good times and in bad. Between 1875 and 1897 there were but two
presidents, Mr. Riddle holding the position until 1883, and then
giving way to Mr. R. R. Cable, who, after directing the policy of
the company for fourteen years, served as chairman of the board of
directors from 1898 to 1901. Among the five members of the executive
committee, if the reckoning is begun with the year 1881, three had
been in office five years by 1886, one 2 years, and one 1 year, or
an average of 3⅗ years. In 1891 two members had been in 10 years,
one 7 years, one 6 years, and one 1 year, or an average of 6⅘ years;
and in 1901 one member had been in 20 years, one 17 years, one 8
years, one 3 years, and one 2 years, or an average of 10 years. The
board of directors showed the same general tendency. In 1890 seven
of the thirteen directors had served for 9 years, and the average
service was 6-3/13 years; in 1897 four of the directors had served
for 16 years, and the average was 9-10/13.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> It was but natural
that men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span> working under these conditions should have been apt to err
on the side of caution rather than on the side of recklessness; and
we find them, therefore, slow to extend their system, and slow to
stretch into new territory where traffic returns were uncertain, and
where the road had to create its business as it went. At the date of
the consolidation the company had become the owner of 1038 miles and
operated under lease 273 miles more, or a total of 1311 miles. By
1883 this had been increased to 1381; but in 1887 the total was only
1384.2, showing a total construction of little over three miles in
four years.</p>

<p>This policy had to be abandoned, for other roads were extending their
lines in Iowa and Illinois, and the Rock Island’s share of Western
business tended to fall off with the construction of rival lines
west of the Missouri. As the report of 1889 expressed it, “while the
lines of this company terminated at the Missouri its competitors for
business had extended beyond, reaching in many cases the extreme
western boundaries of population and even further. Thus the volume
of traffic received by the company for carriage to and from the West
was materially affected, while in order to restore the equilibrium
overbalanced by the reduction in rates, the reverse was necessary,
a larger rather than a smaller share of the tonnage to and from
points west of the Missouri was demanded by the situation.” The
directors were forced against their will to take active measures
in self-protection. As early as 1884 a bond issue was approved for
construction from Minneapolis westward to an eventual junction with
the Northern Pacific.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> Building was to be carried on in the name
of the Wisconsin, Minnesota &amp; Pacific Railroad Company, and the
securities of this company were to be received by the Rock Island as
collateral for the issue which it made.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> Two years later more
extensive plans were put on foot, and the Chicago, Kansas &amp; Nebraska
Railroad Company was organized to carry out construction west of
the Missouri. The new company had a capital stock of $15,000,000,
and then (1887) of $30,000,000, and an indebtedness in 1889 of
$25,141,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>000 6 per cent first mortgage bonds; and turned over all
of its bonds, and practically all of its stock to the Chicago, Rock
Island &amp; Pacific Railway in consideration of advances made to it. The
Rock Island Company in its turn reserved the branch-line bonds as
collateral, and issued against them its own 5 per cent collateral and
extension bonds; agreeing to supply all money needed for construction
and equipment,<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> and leasing the new railway at a rental of 30 per
cent of its gross earnings.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> Under this arrangement 1388 miles
were built by 1889 and 276 leased, making a total of 1664.4. In 1889
it was thought more convenient to consolidate the two systems, so
interest was defaulted on the Chicago, Kansas &amp; Nebraska bonds, and
foreclosure proceedings commenced; resulting in 1891, in spite of
protests by municipalities along the route, in a foreclosure sale
and union of the two properties in name as well as in fact. The
collateral bonds of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific now became
a direct instead of an indirect lien upon the Kansas &amp; Nebraska
mileage.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a></p>

<p>Owing to these operations the mileage of the system increased from
1384 in 1887 to 3257 in 1889, and to 3408 in 1891. The greater part
now lay in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado instead of in Illinois and
Iowa, while at the same time the addition of the new mileage through
sparsely settled districts decreased the density of traffic and the
gross and net receipts per mile of line. In 1887 the Rock Island was
earning the very high return of $8899 gross per mile operated; in
1891 this had fallen to $5126; in 1887 the net return was $3478 per
mile; in 1891 it had fallen to $1484; in other words, the new mileage
brought an increase in traffic, but not nearly so great a traffic per
mile as the Iowa and Illinois lines had enjoyed, while the financing
of the new construction swelled the annual charges from $1,795,351 to
$4,775,601, and even with the larger mileage increased the charges
per mile from $1295 in 1887 to $1400 in 1891. We need not, therefore,
be surprised that the rate of dividends dropped from 7 per cent to 5¾
per cent and then to 4 per cent; nor that the price of common stock
fell from its high level of 140⅞ in May, 1887, to 63⅜ in March, 1891.</p>

<p>It was in this weakened condition that the Rock Island encountered
the panic of 1893 and the years of depression which followed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
and yet, in spite of the marked decrease in business in the years
1895–6–7, it continued to pay dividends, and showed no signs of
financial distress except the lowering of its rate to 2 per cent.
As a matter of fact the road was still in these years one of the
strongest in the United States. Its lines were well located, its
management was conservative, and consequently trusted, and its credit
was good; so that at a time when some of the largest systems in
the United States were being forced to the wall, it was enabled to
preserve its solvency and even to keep up fairly liberal expenditures
for maintenance of way and rolling stock. Little new construction was
of course indulged in. In 1892 an extension was begun from Minco, the
terminus of the Rock Island in the northwest corner of the Indian
Territory, southwards;<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> in 1893 the southern boundary of the
Territory was reached, and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Texas Railway
Company was organized to build through Texas;<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> and in 1894 a
combined line was opened to Fort Worth; but exclusive of the Chicago,
Rock Island &amp; Texas, the total mileage increased by but 360 miles
between 1890 and 1900, being an average of 33 miles a year.</p>

<p>In 1901 Messrs. William H. Moore and D. G. Reid were elected
directors in place of Messrs. H. M. Flagler and H. A. Parker, and
a new era in the road’s affairs began. Mr. Moore had not long been
interested in railroad matters. Known as a daring and successful
promoter of industrial companies, he had made large profits out
of the organization of the National Biscuit and Diamond Match
companies; had lost almost equally large amounts in speculation
which had followed, and had then regained a fortune through the
organization and promotion of companies which were absorbed into
the United Steel Corporation. In these last operations he had
come into contact with Mr. W. B. Leeds, who, though originally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span> a
railroad man, had acquired wealth through a tin-plate plant which
was afterwards turned over to this same Steel Corporation. Mr. Moore
was apparently in 1901 seeking for an investment. He was too well
acquainted with industrial properties to care to sink his money
in them, while he realized that for obvious reasons good railroad
property was as safe, and might be made as profitable as anything
else to which he could turn. The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific
was at the time the system most available for his purpose. It was
not under the control of any large New York interests; it had an
excellent financial record; its mileage was so placed as to admit
of ready expansion; and, moreover, it is probable that to a man of
Mr. Moore’s speculative disposition the very low capitalization of
the road opened up vistas of almost indefinite increase.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> Just
when Mr. Moore and his friends began their purchases, and what price
they paid is of course largely a matter of conjecture: large blocks
of stock were, however, undoubtedly secured in the early months of
1901, during which time quotations ranged from 116⅞ to 136; and it
is probable that the larger part of the purchases were made nearer
the upper than the lower level. During the following year the Moore
party increased their holdings. It has been said that in April, 1901,
Messrs. Moore and Reid were elected to the directorate. In November,
1901, at a special meeting of the stockholders, the directors were
authorized to elect two new members to the executive committee, and
Messrs. Moore and Wm. B. Leeds were chosen. In February, 1902, H. R.
Bishop, Tracey Dows, and F. E. Griggs resigned, and Geo. McMurtry,
F. L. Hine, and F. S. Wheeler were elected directors in their place.
Mr. McMurtry had formerly been president of the American Sheet
Steel Company, merged in the Moore Steel Combine, and Mr. Hines,
vice-president of the First National Bank of New York, presumably
brought the backing of that powerful institution.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> Meanwhile Mr.
James H. Moore had been chosen a director, and the Moore interest had
gained control of the executive committee, so that a majority both
of that committee and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span> the board of directors was in their hands.
The new group of capitalists were not railroad men; their training
had been on the financial side of corporation dealings, and the bulk
of what experience they had had in actual management had been derived
from industrial and not from railroad operations. It was natural,
therefore, that the most striking results from their accession to
power should appear on the financial rather than on the operating
end, and that their ability to manipulate stocks and bonds should
prove more unquestionable than their ability to handle railroad
affairs. Results in the development of the Rock Island system were,
however, attained, and for two reasons: in the first place, the
Moores were able, and above all enterprising men, and untrammelled
by traditions of conservatism, they were quick to see and bold to
execute plans made possible by the admirable location of their 4000
miles of road; in the second place, they soon had large blocks of
securities which they wished to sell, and were impelled to undertake
large operations in the hope of raising quotations upon the Exchange.</p>

<p>In June, 1901, the stockholders authorized an increase in the capital
stock from $50,000,000 to $60,000,000; stockholders of record June
28, 1901, to have the right to subscribe at par.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> The proceeds
were to go in part for extension from Liberal, Kansas, to El Paso,
Texas, and in part for a new depot and elevation of tracks in
Chicago, and for the improvement of the physical condition of the
road. This El Paso extension plan was not new, since in December,
1900, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Mexico, and the Chicago, Rock
Island &amp; El Paso had been incorporated to build a line from Liberal,
Kansas, to Santa Rosa, New Mexico; there to connect with the El
Paso &amp; Northeastern, and to afford a through route to the Pacific
coast and into Mexico. The other plans were, however, new. In April,
1903, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Texas filed an amendment to its
charter providing for an extension from Fort Worth to Galveston,
295 miles. The same month the sale of the Choctaw, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf
to the Rock Island was officially confirmed. This road has been,
with one exception, the most important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span> acquisition of the Moores.
It stretches from Memphis, Tennessee, through the Indian Territory,
Arkansas, and Oklahoma, to the border line of Texas, and furnishes a
nearly direct line from those states to the Mississippi River; while
a projected extension to New Mexico will connect with the Rock Island
main lines to the southward, and make it a valuable link in the
through route from El Paso to Memphis and Birmingham. The Rock Island
paid $80 a share for the common stock and $60 for the preferred,<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a>
and under the terms of the sale agreed to take at the same price all
stock offered. The premium was very large. Choctaw preferred had
been paying 5 per cent for some years, and the common had received
2 per cent in 1889, 4 per cent in 1900, and 4½ per cent in 1901,
plus 10 per cent in stock; but reckoned on a basis of 120 and 160
respectively, these returns sank to a very modest rate. The property
is a valuable one, but will have to show great development to justify
its purchase price. Payment was made by the issue of collateral trust
4 per cent bonds to the amount of $23,520,000, in return for which
practically all of both issues of stock were deposited. Certain
smaller roads were also bought in. In June, 1902, the stockholders
voted to increase the capital stock from $60,000,000 to $75,000,000;
and in July the directors decided to allow the stockholders to
subscribe at par for $8,235,000 of the new issue in amounts equal to
12½ per cent of their holdings;—the new stock to take up shares of
the Burlington, Cedar Rapids &amp; Northern, the Rock Island &amp; Peoria,
and the St. Louis, Kansas City &amp; Colorado.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a> The first of these
roads connected the Rock Island system with Minneapolis and St.
Paul.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> The Rock Island &amp; Peoria was a short line in the state of
Illinois. The St. Louis, Kansas City &amp; Colorado was to afford, when
finished, a more direct route between the important cities of St.
Louis and Kansas City.</p>

<p>This is where matters stood when the reorganization plan of August,
1902, was brought forward. There had been a refunding put through
in 1897 whereby some simplification of bond issues had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span> been
secured;<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> but this scheme of 1902 was for a different purpose
and differed radically in the methods employed. Its explanation is
to be found in the character of the men in control. We have seen
that Mr. Moore had made his reputation in the speculative promotion
of industrial combinations, that he had entered Rock Island in
search of an investment, and that he had thrown himself into the
extension of the system in part because he saw the opportunity for
development, in part because he hoped to pave the way for profitable
manipulation of the stock. The time he had awaited seemed now to
have arrived. His projects had caught public attention, comment on
the whole had been favorable, and the price of his shares was at a
high level; all indications pointed to the probable success of a
scheme of stock-watering on an enormous scale. At the same time Mr.
Moore was too well pleased with the position he had attained to wish
to sacrifice it by the sale of his holdings; and his desire was,
therefore, to devise an arrangement whereby the stock of the Rock
Island should be inflated and large blocks sold to the confiding
public, while the control should remain where it had been before,—in
the hands of Mr. Moore and his followers. It is to be noticed that
there was no call for a reorganization by the creditors of the road,
and no question of a default in interest, or even of a cessation
of dividends upon the common stock; nor, on the other hand, were
earnings so great that the managers felt it unwise to distribute
them. The reason for the reorganization was entirely the financial
ambition of the Moore group and the chance which its members saw of
making larger profits than the earnings of the property would ever
bring.</p>

<p>With these objects the following plan was put through. Instead of
one Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Company the Moores now proposed
to have three companies, of which one was to operate the railroad,
one was to hold the stock of the operating company, and one was to
hold the stock of the company which held the stock of the operating
company. That is to say, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway
Company was left undisturbed, while in Iowa a Chicago, Rock Island &amp;
Pacific Railroad Company was formed to hold the stock of the Railway
Company, and in New Jersey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span> a Rock Island Company was organized to
hold the stock of the Railroad Company, and of such acquisitions as
might afterwards be made. The retention of the Railway Company made
unnecessary the consent of creditors, for the lien and interest rate
of outstanding bonds remained the same as before; the formation of
the Railroad Company served apparently to meet legal requirements;
and the organization of the Rock Island Company seemed likely to
make more easy the purchase of parallel and competing lines. But the
great advantage of the new companies lay in the opportunities for
stock inflation which they presented, together with the lessening
of the amount of capital required for control. This appears plainly
in the following: The old Railway Company had a capital stock of
$75,000,000; the new Railroad Company issued stock to the amount of
$125,000,000 and 4 per cent bonds to the amount of $75,000,000. The
Rock Island Company issued common stock to a total of $96,000,000
and preferred stock to a total of $54,000,000; and the aggregate,
excluding the undisturbed bonds of the Railway Company, footed up to
$425,000,000 instead of to $75,000,000 as before. From this total
must be deducted $200,000,000, which represented issues of stock
by one company to another, and $21,000,000 Rock Island Company
stock and $1,500,000 Railroad Company bonds reserved for future
extension, leaving a net increase from $75,000,000 to $202,500,000.
This involved some increase in fixed charges, since 4 per cent on
$75,000,000 became obligatory; but the true significance lay in
the inflation of principal rather than in the increase of interest
charges, opening as it did an opportunity for great profit to the
managers in the sale of the new securities. An incidental result
was the transformation of the Rock Island shares from investment
securities to media for speculation. At the same time the investment
required for control was diminished. $75,000,000 of Railway stock was
exchanged for $75,000,000 Railroad bonds, $96,000,000 Rock Island
Company common stock, and $54,000,000 Rock Island Company preferred
stock. Of these the bonds obviously had no voting rights. To both
the common and preferred stock the right to vote was given, but in
unequal degrees. “Until the number thereof shall be increased,” read
the certificate of incorporation of the Rock Island Company, “the
number of directors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span> shall be nine. There shall be five classes of
directors. The first class shall contain a majority of the whole
number of the directors as fixed at any time by the by-laws.... The
holders of the preferred stock shall have the right, to the exclusion
of the holders of the common stock, to choose directors of the first
class....” In other words, to the preferred stock, which constituted
a minority of the whole, was given the right to elect a majority of
the board of directors; so that whereas in the old Railway Company
51 per cent of $75,000,000 common stock, selling at from 120 to 179,
had been required for control, in the new combination of companies 51
per cent of $54,000,000 Rock Island Company preferred stock, selling
at 83½, was sufficient to the same end, in spite of a doubling of the
stock outstanding.</p>

<p>To repeat: Two new corporations were formed, of which the Chicago,
Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad Company of Iowa issued $125,000,000
stock to the Rock Island Company of New Jersey, and in return
received $127,500,000 Rock Island preferred and common stock. With
this stock, and with $75,000,000 of its own bonds, the Railroad
Company purchased the $75,000,000 stock of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp;
Pacific Railway Company, paying for every $100 in shares</p>

<p class="in0 in2">
$100 in Rock Island Company common stock;<br />
  70 in Rock Island Company preferred stock; and<br />
 100 in its own 4 per cent bonds.
</p>

<p>The Railway shares acquired were pledged for the Railroad bonds,
and from them came the total income of the Railroad Company; and
dividends upon the Railroad shares, together with dividends upon
shares of other companies which it might chance to own, constituted
the total income of the Rock Island Company. After thus receiving
indirectly the earnings of the Railway Company through two sets of
dividends, the Rock Island Company paid dividends on its own shares,
which were held by the public; the preferred stock being entitled to
4 per cent from 1903 to 1909 inclusive, to 5 per cent from 1910 to
1916 inclusive, and to 6 per cent thereafter.</p>

<p>Other provisions were as follows: The Rock Island common stock might
be increased from time to time according to law, but the amount of
the preferred stock could not be increased except with the assent
of the holders of two-thirds of the entire preferred stock and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
two-thirds of the entire common stock at the time outstanding,
given at a meeting called for that purpose. Preferred stock was
to be preferred as to principal as well as to interest; it had
the right, as has been said, to elect a majority of the board of
directors, but this right could be surrendered by the affirmative
vote of the holders of two-thirds in amount of the preferred stock
at the time outstanding at a special meeting of the holders of the
preferred stock called for that purpose. A Finance Committee might be
appointed from and by the directors which should have such powers as
the directors and stockholders should choose to give it, and which
should have all the powers of the directors when the board was not
in session. The directors might accumulate working capital, but no
reservation for working capital should be made in any year out of
the surplus or net profits of such year until after the payments for
such year of the dividends on the preferred stock of the company.
The directors might also use the working capital in purchasing or
acquiring the shares of the capital stock of the company as they
might deem expedient, but shares so purchased might be resold unless
retired for the purpose of decreasing the capital stock of the
company.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> This last provision aroused so much criticism that the
directors gave up the right of dealing in the shares of their own
company by resolution of November 5, 1902.</p>

<p>The important features of this reorganization were, as has
been indicated, those in connection with the inflation of the
capitalization and with the control of the property. In this
connection it may be asked, first, whether the Moores made a profit
by the deal; second, how large an investment they have had to keep in
the property in order to retain control; and third, what cost to them
this investment represents.</p>

<p>On January 2, 1902, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company
common was quoted at 154. On February 1 it was 162¼, on April 1, 179,
on July 1, 172½, on August 1, 190, on October 1, 200, and on November
1, 199½. It is safe to assume that the rise from 172½ to 200 was
due to the publication of the plan, and it may be that some of the
earlier increase in value was owing to purchases by insiders, or by
people who had obtained some inkling of what was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span> being considered;
but a comparison of the aggregate value of the securities given for
the railway common stock on January 3, 1903, with the price of the
stock on July 1, 1902, shows that the former exceeded the latter by
22.3 points, with the error tending toward an understatement of the
excess. That is, for every $172½ invested in July, 1902, the Moores,
and other stockholders with them, held securities worth $194.8 in
January of the following year. During 1903 the Rock Island securities
fell with others upon the market, till on January 2, 1904, the
aggregate value of the stocks and bonds in question was only $132.2;
but the decline was temporary, and by January 3, 1905, recovery to
$176.6 had taken place. The operations therefore did result in a
chance for large profits, and gave renewed evidence that the public
demand for stocks and bonds does not fall off proportionately to an
increase in their volume.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that neither before nor after the reorganization could
the Moores have sold all their holdings and yet have kept control.
Starting again with the price of 172½ for Chicago, Rock Island &amp;
Pacific Railway common on July 1, 1902, it may be calculated that
the cost of a majority of the issue then footed up to $64,687,672.
If this had been carried on margin, and the brokers had demanded on
every share a deposit of $40, with $40 more instantly available if
needed, the total investment required for control would have been
$15,000,040, with as much more held in readiness for any emergency.
On January 2, 1903, Rock Island preferred stock was selling at
83½, and the cost of a majority of the whole issue would have been
$22,545,083; which, if carried on margin with a deposit of $20 a
share, would have represented an investment of $5,400,020, with as
much more in reserve. In other words, while all went well, less than
$11,000,000 sufficed to control properties with a total mileage
of 7718 miles of line, a bonded indebtedness of $201,660,475, and
an outstanding capital stock of $118,249,007. It is of course
improbable that the Moores in 1903 carried all, or even a large
part of their holdings on margin; supposing, therefore, that all of
their stock was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span> bought and paid for, the fact still remains that
with $22,545,083 they were able to control a system capitalized at
$319,909,482.</p>

<p>In examining the cost to the Moores it is at once to be said that
these gentlemen did not pay 172½ for their old Railway stock. What
they did pay is of course uncertain. It is known that much of their
holdings was acquired in the early months of 1901, when prices ranged
from 116⅞ to 136. An average of 140 would represent a conservative
estimate of what they paid, at which price a majority of the
$75,000,000 would have cost $52,500,140. In return for this stock, at
the prices of January 2, 1903, they obtained</p>

<p>Since the preferred stock sufficed for control, there were left
$18,375,049 of Rock Island Company common, and $32,765,712 of
Railroad Company bonds, or a total of securities with a nominal
market value of $51,140,761. Deducting this from the original
investment, which has been estimated at $52,500,140, there is left
$1,359,379 to represent the actual cost to the Moore crowd of control
of the great Rock Island property. Beneath all of these figures lies,
of course, the erroneous assumption that it would have been possible
to unload large blocks of securities upon the market without causing
a break in price; and yet, though large deductions must be made
on this account, the figures are eloquent of the skill with which
the Moores have manipulated Rock Island issues, and of the slender
basis on which their control rests. It has been truly said that the
question is raised anew as to what is legitimate in corporate finance.</p>

<p>All this is very different from anything described before; and so
far as motives go, the two Rock Island reorganizations stand by
themselves. In the matter of methods some similarities appear. The
great increase in capitalization resting on the Rock Island system
was accomplished mainly by an inflation of stock, not of mortgage
bonds, and involved a comparatively slight increase in fixed
charges; the Rock Island Company closely resembled other holding
companies in its method of operation, and seemed likely to offer some
facilities for the consolidation of competing lines; and though the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
extraordinary privileges given the Rock Island preferred stock have
perhaps never been paralleled in degree, the practice of granting
such stock preferential treatment in other things than dividends
is not unknown. On the whole, however, this kind of reorganization
stands apart, and is rather instructive as showing what may be done
in the handling of corporation securities than in indicating any
sound principles on which bankrupt roads may proceed.</p>

<p>The reorganization plan aroused sharp criticism both from Wall
Street<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> and from the wider public, but met no opposition
sufficient to prevent its being carried through. In September
Attorney-General C. W. Mullen, of Iowa, in an opinion filed with
the Governor of that state, held that the acts of the new Iowa
corporation of the Rock Island, <i>i. e.</i> the Chicago, Rock Island &amp;
Pacific Railroad Company, were not outside the powers conferred by
statute.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> The Governor, in concurring with the opinion from a
legal point of view, added, “the thing done is neither a merger nor
a consolidation. Not a mile of track nor a dollar in value is added
to the Rock Island property. It is simply a new device for watering
securities; it is for the next General Assembly to say whether
it is wise to permit our laws to so remain that such things are
possible.”<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> The various corporations were, therefore, organized,
and the various issues of stocks and bonds put forth.</p>

<p>During the past four years the events which require mention are four:
First, the acquisition of the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco; second, the
connection of the Rock Island with the Gulf; third, the temporary
control of the Chicago &amp; Alton; and fourth, the issue of a new
refunding mortgage.</p>

<p>In October, 1903, the Rock Island operated 7123 miles of line. Its
tracks stretched southwest from Chicago to Santa Rosa, New Mexico,
west from Memphis to Tucumcari, and northwest from Rock Island,
Illinois, to Minneapolis and St. Paul, and to Watertown, South
Dakota. This extensive mileage surrounded, however, instead of
occupying, a large territory in Missouri, Kansas, Indian Territory,
and Arkansas, and could claim no share in the vast traffic passing
up and down the Mississippi Valley. One of the first acts of the
Moores was to remedy this defect. In May, 1903, the Rock Island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
made a formal offer to purchase any and all shares of the St. Louis
&amp; San Francisco Railroad Company, providing $22,500,000 in par value
should accept, at a rate of $60 par value in the common stock of the
Rock Island Company and $60 par value in a new issue of 5 per cent
gold bonds of 1913 of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad
Company, for each $100 par value of Frisco common stock deposited;
the new bonds to be secured by the stock acquired. This Frisco
Company, it will be remembered, was the same that had previously
been acquired and given up by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe. Since
that time it had greatly extended its mileage, had gained control
of the prosperous Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois, with entrance into
Chicago, and was altogether more valuable than it had been before. In
relation to the Rock Island it possessed precisely the mileage which
was required. It connected the latter’s terminus at Chicago with the
terminus of the Choctaw, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf at Memphis; it traversed
Southern Illinois, Southern Missouri, Southeastern Kansas, and Indian
Territory, to say nothing of lines in Oklahoma and in Texas; and by
means of a line from Memphis to Birmingham it gave entrance into the
heart of the South. In brief, it filled the gaps in the southeastern
part of the Rock Island system, and afforded a solid foundation for
further expansion. Good authorities consider the price which the Rock
Island gave for the Frisco to have been too high. It is certain that
the Frisco stockholders jumped at the chance. By June 1, 1903, the
necessary $22,500,000 worth of stock had given their consent and only
technical details remained to be carried through.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a></p>

<p>With the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco under its control the Rock Island
could make a final advance to the Gulf. An attempt to complete a
road through Texas occurred simultaneously with the Frisco purchase
in 1903. The Moores, that is, arranged with the Southern Pacific for
the purchase of a half-interest in the Houston &amp; Texas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span> Central,
from Fort Worth to Houston and Galveston, with a branch to Austin,
Texas; the Houston, East &amp; West Texas, extending north from Houston
to Shreveport, Louisiana; and the Texas &amp; New Orleans, from Dallas
to Sabine Lake on the Gulf of Mexico. As a part of the agreement the
presidents of these lines were to be selected by the Rock Island
Company.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> This would have established a line to the coast in a
very satisfactory manner. Connection between Dallas and Fort Worth
was to be completed in December, 1903, and from this point the two
lines of the Houston &amp; Texas Central and the Texas &amp; New Orleans
would have furnished direct outlets to the Gulf. The scheme did not
go through, because the Texas Railroad Commissioners pronounced
the contracts contrary to the state constitution, in that they
amounted to a consolidation of the corporations concerned, and to the
establishment of a community of interest between the Rock Island and
the Southern Pacific, which would preclude competition between them
in respect to their Texas business.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> The Rock Island was at first
disposed to test part of the decision in the courts.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> It later
decided that discretion was the better part of valor, stopped the
transaction, and cancelled the stock which it had issued as part of
the purchase price.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a></p>

<p>What the company could not do in Texas it could do, however, in
Missouri, Louisiana, and Arkansas. As early as November, 1902, the
St. Louis &amp; San Francisco had purchased the entire capital stock
of the St. Louis, Memphis &amp; Southeastern Railroad, a line which
was opened from St. Louis in 1904 to a junction with a branch of
the Frisco above Memphis. From Memphis the Kansas City, Memphis &amp;
Birmingham stretched southeast through Mississippi into Alabama.
These roads formed a basis for extension which was practicable
though less convenient than the western route. Accordingly, in 1904,
trackage agreements were concluded which gave to the Rock Island
system:</p>

<p>(1) Trackage rights over the Mobile &amp; Ohio and the New Orleans &amp;
Northeastern between Tupelo, Mississippi (on the Kansas City, Memphis
&amp; Birmingham), and New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>

<p>(2) Trackage rights over the St. Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span> and
the Texas &amp; Pacific from a point opposite Memphis, Tennessee, to a
point opposite Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>

<p>(3) Trackage rights over the Yazoo &amp; Mississippi Valley between Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, and over certain tracks
in the latter city.</p>

<p>This afforded alternative routes of considerable directness from
Memphis to the Gulf, while from the junctions of the Frisco with the
Southern roads freight could be sent north to St. Louis and Chicago
over the Rock Island system’s own rails. Arrangements were made for
the construction of terminals in New Orleans by a subsidiary company
whose stock was to be owned and whose bonds were to be guaranteed by
the Southern and the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco companies.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></p>

<p>At the present time the Rock Island is reaching south at two points
other than those so far mentioned. Under the name of the Rock Island,
Arkansas &amp; Louisiana Railroad Company,<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> it has built almost due
south from Little Rock, Arkansas, while from New Orleans to Houston
it has completed a line which connects at Eunice, Louisiana, with the
Rock Island, Arkansas &amp; Louisiana, and at Houston with the Trinity &amp;
Brazos Valley Railway.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> This last line runs from Houston to Fort
Worth and Dallas, Texas, and is controlled by a half-interest in its
capital stock. The Rock Island is thus in fair shape to share in the
south-bound grain movement from Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas,
and to take a part in the north and south business of the Mississippi
Valley. There is no question but what the company is making a bold
bid for an enormous traffic, and that failure will not be due to any
narrowness of view.</p>

<p>About the time that it was struggling to reach the Gulf the Rock
Island took hold of the Chicago &amp; Alton in the north in order to have
another and a more direct line between Kansas City and Chicago.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span> A
strong minority interest had previously been bought in the Alton by
Mr. Harriman, and a board of directors had been elected. In 1904 the
Rock Island bought within a few hundred shares of absolute control,
and since the classification of the board prevented the displacement
of its opponents for two years, arranged a compromise. Between them
the Harriman and the Rock Island interests deposited a controlling
number of Alton shares with the Central Trust Company of New York, to
be held in a voting trust. Each of the rival interests was to have
five directors, and the odd director was to be in alternate years
first a Harriman and then a Rock Island man.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> The Rock Island
was, further, to have an option on the Harriman holdings for two
years. It was an unfortunate time to buy. Mr. Harriman had previously
displayed his splendid dividend producing ability in Alton finance,
and the road was short of money. Market conditions were unfavorable,
bonds were hard to sell, and, after all, the Alton was not of vital
importance to the Rock Island, although it opened up new territory
of some considerable importance. By 1907 it seems that the Moores
had become tired of their bargain. In June of that year they served
notice on the Union Pacific that the compromise agreement of 1904 was
illegal and should be abrogated;<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> and shortly after they sold
their holdings to the Toledo, St. Louis &amp; Western.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a></p>

<p>All in all the growth of the Rock Island has been astounding. Instead
of the limited number of 7123 miles which the system possessed
in 1903, or the 3819 of 1901, it comprises 14,270 miles of line
operated in 1907. Gross earnings are $112,464,000 in 1907 as against
$25,365,000 in 1901; net income $40,828,000 instead of $8,901,000;
capitalization about $525,000,000 instead of $118,081,000. In fact,
the very size of the system and the diverse nature of its interests
make the economical management of the whole almost beyond the
capacity of any one man. The Rock Island handles traffic from the
West and South to Chicago, St. Louis, and Birmingham, and connects
with the trunk lines to the Atlantic coast; it is also striving
to receive and care for the constantly increasing business from
the Northwest to the Gulf. It reaches into Mexico; it extends into
Colorado, and sends branches into the Northwest; while at the other
end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span> it connects Kansas City, Memphis, and St. Louis by a triangle
of lines. It was remarked a year ago that a contrast between the
operations of the Rock Island and of the Atchison lines in the
Southwest disclosed what might be called demoralization on the part
of the former, and it is in the multiplicity of its operations that
the cause must be sought.</p>

<p>It is to be expected, therefore, that the financial position of the
company should not be secure. Operating expenses, fixed charges,
and taxes absorbed 87 per cent of gross income in 1907 and 89 per
cent the year before. We must not be blinded by the magnitude of the
reported figures. Although $9,476,397 were carried to surplus in the
year ending June 30, 1907, and $5,568,092 were paid out in dividends,
these two items together comprise only about 13 per cent of gross
income, and a bad year might readily see a decrease sufficient to
sweep this margin away. Unlike the Union Pacific and the Northern
Pacific, moreover, the Rock Island has not made consistently heavy
improvement expenditures from income. Less than $40,000 was deducted
by either the Frisco or the Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway in 1905 or
in 1907; less than half a million in 1904; a little over two millions
in 1903 and in 1906. And this in spite of the fact that the mileage
of the Rock Island system is greater than that of any other road
which this study has taken up. The fate of the company’s refunding
mortgage of 1904 probably testified as much to the distrust of the
Moore group of financiers and of the soundness of the property which
they control as it did to the general financial uneasiness of the
time. This proposition for a refunding mortgage was first framed in
July, 1903. It then comprised an issue of $250,000,000 4 per cent
bonds, to be used for the refunding of outstanding obligations,
future enlargements and construction, purchase of bonds and stocks of
other companies, and for the reimbursing of the company for advances
already made. Subscriptions were sought in New York in vain. Whereas
the project was to have come up at a meeting of the stockholders on
October 8, the managers obtained an adjournment of this meeting until
January without action, and before that month arrived announced an
indefinite postponement of operations. On March 21 the stockholders
voted on and approved a modified version of the original scheme,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
whereby $163,000,000 instead of $250,000,000 were authorized, of
which $15,000,000 were to be issued at once, and $82,025,000 were to
be reserved for retiring certain outstanding obligations. It proved
no easier to secure subscriptions to this than to the previous plan,
and in April $5,000,000 4½ per cent notes were issued instead and
taken by the First National Bank of New York, which was already
closely identified with the company. Not until November, 1904, after
fourteen and one-half months of persistent effort, was a firm of
bankers found to take the refunding issue. $25,108,000 were then sold
to Speyer &amp; Co. Mr. Speyer became a director of the Rock Island and
entered the finance committee, while the proceeds of the sale went to
reimburse the treasury for capital expended, and to provide for the
payment of obligations maturing in 1905. Since this time other blocks
of the bonds have been sold.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that the Rock Island has not regained the position
which it held prior to the operations of Mr. Moore and of his
friends. The recent developments have done two things: they have
piled upon the company a mass of excessive capitalization; and they
have transformed it from a moderate sized railroad with a clearly
defined flow of traffic into a great system sprawled over the Central
West and handling at least three different currents of business.
Neither one of these changes alone can account for the present
condition of the road. Together they have made it what it is. It
is only fair to say that large sums from capital account are being
spent upon the property and that the managers announce an intention
of bringing it up to the highest standard of physical condition.
Over $4,000,000 were appropriated for additions and improvements
in 1907, and nearly $3,500,000 in 1906, besides still greater sums
for construction and equipment. Heavier rails have been laid down,
bridges have been strengthened, equipment increased and improved.
Meanwhile maintenance charges have not been unduly low, though not so
high as on some other Western roads. It is true, nevertheless, that
the Rock Island has lost its former stability and must await a period
of lessened earnings with serious apprehension.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">A</span> general survey of railroad reorganizations may now be attempted.
Eighteen different ones and no less than forty-two reorganization
plans have been examined in detail. In their seemingly infinite
variety may not some guiding principles be found which will assist
both in interpreting the past and in directing the future?<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a></p>

<p>It is apparent that a readjustment of a railroad’s affairs is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
difficult than the readjustment of those of an individual. A railroad
is a complex financial, as well as a complex operating machine.
Especially when it has been built up by the union of numerous small
properties, each of which has been allowed to retain a certain
individuality of its own, are the relations between the different
parts intricate and involved. The obligations which have been
incurred in the course of its career, and the kinds of paper which
represent these obligations, disclose a variety which the debts of
an individual seldom or never present. This complexity in railroad
capitalization inevitably leads to clashes in interest between
different classes of securityholders. Divergencies in interest seem
to appear even while a road is solvent. If classes of securities
exist upon which payment of interest is optional, it is to the
advantage of the junior issues to prevent payment of interest or
dividends upon others until earnings are such that payment may be
made upon all. If common stockholders can reinvest in the property
sums which normally would be paid in dividends on the preferred
stock, they advance the day upon which they can secure dividends for
themselves at the expense of their seniors. The same situation may
also arise as between the preferred stock and the income bonds. Or,
again, it may be to the advantage of speculative stockholders to pay
dividends to themselves by means of the accumulation of a floating
debt, and to sell out at top quotations, leaving the floating debt
to take precedence even of mortgage bonds.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> Both this and the
preceding operation are facilitated by the control which the least
valuable portion of the capital, the common stock, usually has over
the policy of the entire company. But it is when a reorganization
becomes necessary that these conflicts in interest become most
apparent, and it is as a compromise between contending forces that a
reorganization plan must take its shape.</p>

<p>The term “reorganization” is used in this study to denote the
exchange of new securities for the principal of outstanding,
unmatured, general mortgage bonds, or for at least 50 per cent of the
unmatured junior mortgages of any company, or for the whole of the
capital stock. These exchanges have been the essential features of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
the operations which have been described. This exchange of securities
must take place upon a considerable scale. Small readjustments
may involve valuations of specific bits of property, but they do
not require that comprehensive survey of the relations of all
parts of the system to each other which distinguishes the general
reorganization. In fact, the small adjustments are at once more
simple and more difficult than the larger kind. More simple because
they involve less change; more difficult because the same pressure
cannot often be brought to bear. It is useful to mark a dividing-line
between the small and the large. No such line can be defended as
exact; but the one chosen seems to include a tolerably homogeneous
group, and will lend a convenient definiteness to the discussion.</p>

<p>As thus defined, a reorganization may be, and generally is,
accompanied by other operations essential to its success. If a large
floating debt has been accumulated, provision for the cancellation of
this debt must be made;<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> if unprofitable leases have been entered
into, these must be abolished;<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> or if the system has been unduly
hampered by inability to issue new capital, appropriate relief must
be afforded. But none of these are determining features. They are
means to an end, as is the exchange of new securities for old, and
they may have their effect just as the economical management of the
Union Pacific under Charles Francis Adams had its effect in the years
prior to 1890; but they are not essential parts of that group of
operations which have been characterized as reorganizations.</p>

<p>The exchange of new securities for old on a large scale usually takes
place when a railroad is unable to meet maturing obligations.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span> Of
18 reorganizations and 42 plans, 15 reorganizations and 39 plans
have had to do with the extrication of companies from financial
embarrassment. But though impending insolvency is the usual
occasion it is not the only one. Reorganization sometimes occurs
when prosperity is too great as well as when it is too little. Or
a management may desire to get rid of hampering restrictions, or
it may desire to manipulate the conditions of control. This last
named cause—the desire to manipulate conditions of control—has
been fortunately an infrequent cause of reorganization. An example
is, however, afforded by the Rock Island reorganization of 1902. It
will be remembered that the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway
had long been a prosperous road in the Middle West, and that its
control had required the ownership of between 40 and 50 per cent of
$75,000,000 of common stock, quoted at over 160 in the early part
of 1902. By the issue of new bonds, new preferred and new common
stock to a total of $270 for every $100 of old common stock, and by
giving to the preferred stockholders the right to elect a majority
of the directors, the owners of the property were able to part with
a large portion of their holdings and yet retain absolute control. A
somewhat similar case was that of the Chicago &amp; Alton. This road had
been a conservatively capitalized enterprise, doing a large business
between Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. It had paid 7 per cent
or better on its two classes of stock for eighteen years without a
break, and had accumulated in that time an uncapitalized construction
expenditure of $12,444,178. In 1899 a syndicate of Eastern
capitalists bought control, and the following year reorganized the
property by forming a holding company, which issued $22,000,000
in 3½ per cent bonds, $19,489,000 in preferred and $19,542,800 in
common stock to exchange for the $22,230,600 old common and preferred
shares outstanding. At current prices on January 3, 1899, a majority
of both the old issues would have cost $19,030,048; on January 4,
1901, however, a majority of both of the new issues represented
an investment of $10,729,437; and this investment it would have
been possible to reduce to $2,241,377 by the sale of the new bonds
received, without in any way endangering control.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
It is evident that both the Rock Island and the Chicago &amp; Alton
reorganizations were influenced by the very great prosperity of
the companies concerned. It was desired to reap a profit by the
sale of new securities as well as to lessen the investment required
for control; although it may be remarked that the advantage of
retaining control depended on the future prosperity of the roads.
Reorganizations concerned with manipulation of control are therefore
closely allied with reorganizations due to too great prosperity.
These latter may, however, take place independently, and are
likely to occur whenever profits are extraordinarily large, and a
simple stock dividend is deemed inadvisable. An example was the
reorganization of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific in 1880, when
the formation of a new company and the exchange of new stock for
old was deemed wise, in view of the large earnings which were to be
distributed.</p>

<p>The desire to eliminate hampering restrictions is seldom the sole
cause for a reorganization, but frequently it is a contributing one.
When, for instance, the managers of the Union Pacific wished to
extend their system in the years following 1880, they were forced
to establish a separate organization for each branch line. By the
terms of the charter nothing could be consolidated with the main stem
except the Kansas Pacific and the Denver Pacific, the consolidation
with which was provided for in the original acts.<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> This obviously
prevented considerable economies, and could be remedied only by a
new incorporation. The Northern Pacific was hampered in yet another
way because the consent of three-fourths of the preferred stock was
required by the terms of the reorganization of 1875 to the imposition
of new mortgages;<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> and similarly the Atchison, after 1889, found
it extremely difficult to issue new bonds because of the position of
the outstanding income bonds. In this last case the restriction was
the sole cause of the reorganization which followed. It should be
remarked that the cancellation of such provisions sometimes works<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
considerable injustice. Restrictions on future increases in capital,
for instance, may have facilitated the issue of bonds in the past,
and in this case have formed part of the consideration given for
subscriptions. The readjustment is defended on the ground of the need
of the corporation, or is so accomplished as not to lessen the value
of the creditors’ holdings.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a></p>

<p>The typical railroad reorganization, as has been said, occurs
when a road ceases to be able to pay interest on its outstanding
obligations. Whether because of excessive capitalization or because
of unexpectedly low earnings, or owing to an accumulation of floating
debt which ties up all current resources, the reorganizing railroad
finds itself incapable of meeting payments falling due. For this,
experience shows that two deep-seated causes have generally been
responsible. First, there is the almost entire freedom in matters
of capitalization which railroads have enjoyed. Far from the
recommendation of Secretary Taft that no railroad company engaged in
interstate commerce be permitted to issue stock or bonds and put them
on sale in the market except after a certificate by the Interstate
Commerce Commission that the securities are issued with the approval
of the Commission for a legitimate railroad purpose,<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> American
railroads have in the past been practically unrestricted. It was open
to the Erie to increase its capitalization per mile from $81,068
in 1864 to $117,760 in 1872, with no corresponding addition to its
property; it was open to the Union Pacific to create a capitalization
of $104,561 per mile by 1870, of which about one-quarter was in
the form of government bonds; and it was possible for the Atchison
to issue $129,162,350 in new bonds and stocks between 1884 and
1889 while its net earnings seriously decreased. Had there been a
supervision of new issues, or had even a certain percentage of stocks
to bonds in those instances been required, failures would have been
less frequent and reorganizations less common. New construction
would probably have been less rapid, but not so much so as is often
asserted. A smaller number of new enterprises might have yielded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
larger profits; the chances for land speculation might have tempted
many, and liberal regulations might have allowed a generous profit
while at the same time eliminating all inflation due to fraud.
Unfortunately railroad-hungry communities seldom stopped to count
the cost. West, South, North, and East, privileges were offered to
railroads, donations of land and money were made, and exemptions from
taxation were conferred.</p>

<p>The second fundamental cause of railroad distress has been
competition. If unrestricted capitalization has increased the load
which the railroads have had to bear, unrestricted competition has
impaired their ability to support any load at all. The forms which
this competition has taken have been mainly two: first, the cutting
of rates, either openly or by secret concessions; second, reckless
extensions of line, generally followed by rate-cutting. The cutting
of railroad rates is now a subject familiar to all. Illustrations
may be found in the history of any great railroad system. President
Hadley has made classical the theory that roads will take business
until rates fall below the specific cost of hauling a given shipment;
that is, below the additional cost which the articles in question
impose. Even this limitation is often non-existent. Railroads which
serve different cities will take freight when a war is in progress
whether or not the rate repays the specific cost of hauling. If
their rival imitates them they hope to wear it out by their superior
ability to stand the loss. If it does not, the city which they
serve will temporarily eject all others from common market, and
may obtain so firm a footing that a permanent increase in business
will result. All of the railroads which have been studied, in fact,
have suffered more or less from rate-cutting. Repeated attempts at
pooling and agreements to maintain rates have improved conditions
only during the short periods in which the agreements have been
of effect. In the South there have been scarcely more successful
attempts to secure harmony by community of stock control. Competition
by means of extensions has been also vigorously practised. The reader
will recall the growth of the Atchison from 1884 to 1889. It was
after the dissolution of the Southern Railway Security Company that
the East Tennessee entered upon its policy of purchase and of new
construction. The entrance of the Reading into New England was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span> the
direct cause of its failure in 1893; and that of the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio into New York largely contributed to its difficulties in 1887.
Sometimes such extension is into territory where there is no business
to justify it. Sometimes the business is there, but has to be divided
among too many rivals. Sometimes the new lines are so poorly built as
to be unduly expensive to work, and not infrequently they are so good
that the resources of the expanding road are strained in acquiring
them. In any one of these four cases new extension causes a drain
upon the parent road which may readily bring about its failure.</p>

<p>Other conditions may lead to railroad failure. Simon Sterne alleges
the following causes to be often responsible:<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></p>

<p>1. The control of railroads by stock which represents little or no
original cash investment.</p>

<p>2. The development of the territory served by individual railroads at
a slower rate than is anticipated, and the influence of competition
in reducing profits when the territory has developed.</p>

<p>3. The undertaking of railway construction when there is considerable
activity in the money market, and when capital commands a high rate
of interest.</p>

<p>4. The circumstance that railways, lacking reserve capital, can never
avail themselves of a cheap market for labor or supplies, but must
always buy when everything is inflated, because then only can they
float their loans and borrow capital.</p>

<p>5. The necessity of complete reconstruction within a brief period
of most railroads built through new territory, and the increase in
funded and in floating debt involved.</p>

<p>7. The growth of railroads beyond the ability to handle them.</p>

<p>8. The steadily increasing expenditures required by law to
accommodate the public.</p>

<p>9. The abuse of their position by directors and trustees.</p>

<p>10. The irresponsibility of railway accounts.</p>

<p>And it may be added that the control of American railways by foreign
investors who apportion charges between operating and capital
accounts in a way unsuited to American conditions has been upon
occasion a cause of disaster. Unlimited freedom in matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span> of
capitalization and unrestricted competition have nevertheless been
the fundamental causes of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the majority of the principal
railroads which failed in the nineties had taxed their resources
nearly to the point of exhaustion before the panic of 1893 finally
drove them to the wall. For every $100 received in 1892 the Richmond
&amp; Danville and East Tennessee systems were paying out $68.79 for
operating expenses and $31.15 for interest on bonds, rentals, etc.,
leaving only 6 cents for dividends, necessary improvements, and
the like. For every $100 received the Erie paid out the same year
$66.46 for operating expenses and $31.85 for interest and other fixed
charges, leaving only $1.68 as a surplus to ensure solvency in case
of a decline in earnings. In 1893 the Atchison, the Northern Pacific,
the Reading, and the Union Pacific had no surplus at all, but rather
a deficit. The following table shows similar figures for all of our
reorganized roads:</p>

<p>With these figures may be compared statistics for seven roads which
went through the depression of 1893–7 without failure. These roads
had a more extensive margin which could be cut off before interest
on their bonds should be endangered. Furthermore, this margin was
secured, not by low operating expenses, but by low fixed charges,
including interest on bonds. Operating expenses averaged higher than
for the preceding group, fixed charges averaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span> much lower. In the
first group but one road had charges in 1893 which were less than
25 per cent of gross income; in the second group but two roads had
charges which were greater. The condition of the roads of the second
group referred to was as follows:</p>

<p>The causes which lead to railroad failure have now been mentioned.
When bankruptcy has at last occurred, three groups of interests
take part in the reorganization which must ensue. These are the
creditors, who find interest and perhaps principal of their bonds
in default; the stockholders; and the bankers and financiers who
advance ready money and subscribe to necessary guarantees. Of these
the creditors and the stockholders are widely scattered, and are
quite unable to protect themselves by individual action. Their first
impulse is, therefore, either to elect committees to represent them,
or to authorize self-appointed committees of well-known men to look
after their interests. Stockholders in a reorganization have little
voice. They are the owners, and all that the corporation has is
subject first to the bondholders from whom it has borrowed money.
Occasionally they seem to make their influence felt. In 1880 the
Reading actually attempted to pay off its floating debt by bonds with
a lien inferior to the common stock; and in 1892 the Olcott plan for
the reorganization of the Richmond Terminal Company strongly favored
the junior securities. But as a rule stockholders must accept, and
rightly, about what the creditors desire.</p>

<p>The creditors, then, are the most important factors, and they, like
the stockholders, act through committees. There may be a committee
for every class of bonds, or one or more classes may join together.
The Union Pacific, in 1893, had committees for the consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
first mortgage, the collateral trust 5s, the Oregon Railway &amp;
Navigation consols, the Dutch bondholders, and certain branch lines;
and in 1894 for the collateral trust 4½s and the Kansas Pacific
consols. As the financial situation grew worse the interest on
senior mortgages became imperilled, and even the Union Pacific first
mortgage bondholders deemed it wise to elect a committee; while a
second committee arose for the Kansas Pacific consols, and a new
committee for the Denver Extension mortgage. By April, 1895, at
least fifteen committees were in active operation, of which fourteen
represented not more than two classes of bonds each. The Reading
reorganization of 1884 to 1886 was largely shaped by two committees
representing the general mortgage bondholders; seven reorganization
trustees representing the foreign creditors, the general, income,
junior securities, and stockholders; and an opposition committee
known as the Lockwood Committee. Within four months after the failure
of the Erie in 1875 the English bondholders and stockholders each
had elected a committee, and had urged all securityholders to join;
a meeting of bondholders had elected Mr. John Hooper chairman of a
committee in New York; and another meeting had elected Mr. N. B. Lord
chairman of another committee in that city.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> The more general a
committee the greater the influence which it seems able to exert on
reorganization, and the greater the likelihood that the plan which
it approves may be accepted. The fact that a scheme has to meet the
criticism of opposing interests during its formation renders it less
likely to contain any injustice which conditions make it possible to
avoid; and the endorsement of their representatives makes all classes
of bondholders more ready to accord it temperate consideration. Among
the numerous Union Pacific committees it was the joint committee,
representing the foreign holders, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande, the
Oregon Railway &amp; Navigation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span> and other interests that took the
leading part. In the case of the Reading from 1884 to 1886 the seven
reorganization trustees outweighed any other representatives of
the creditors; in that of the Northern Pacific the Adams Committee
succeeded in becoming a general reorganization committee, and took
the leading part; and the Atchison reorganization was accomplished
only by the union into a joint executive reorganization committee of
three of the previously existing bodies.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></p>

<p>The situation which bankers and financiers occupy in relation to a
bankrupt road is almost equally important. Their aid is essential
to a reorganization while that of the officers and receivers of
the company is not. And they are not subject to the pressure of
imminent financial loss which forces creditors and stockholders to
accept plans of which they do not altogether approve. It is true
that these bankers may have money invested in the securities of the
road. It may even happen that they have been formerly in control.
In this case a certain pressure does exist. But as bankers their
function is to do one or both of two things; namely, to advance
cash to keep the railroad system together pending reorganization,
and to underwrite assessments or the sale of securities. Either
one of these involves them in new risks, and in undertaking either
they will be only indirectly affected by investments which they
may previously have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span> made. Their influence on reorganization is
strong because they are necessary, and because they are free to
participate or not to participate according to their opinion of the
precise reorganization plan proposed. For much the same reason their
influence is a wholesome one. We shall see that the primary conflict
which takes place in any reorganization is between the interests
of the corporation which needs a lessening of its burdens, and the
interests of the securityholders which is opposed to any reduction in
their claims.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> The degree to which the former interest prevails
determines the strength of the reorganized company. In this conflict
the bankers naturally take the side of the company. As bankers,
who advance cash, and who usually receive their pay in securities,
they wish to make the corporation prosperous, and to raise the
quotations of its securities to a high figure. An important factor
also is that as reputable banking firms they wish the future career
of corporations which they have handled to reflect credit upon
themselves.</p>

<p>An example of the influence of bankers and financiers appears in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
the case of the Union Pacific. A committee comprising General
Louis Fitzgerald, Jacob Schiff, T. J. Coolidge, Oliver Ames, and
two railway presidents took the road out of receivers’ hands, cut
charges per mile by over one-half, and paid the Government’s claim
in full. The Reading reorganization of 1886 to 1887 was the work
of a syndicate which took hold after interests closely connected
with the properties had failed to produce a satisfactory plan. The
result was the best plan ever applied to the Reading Railroad. The
Richmond Terminal Company was reorganized by a single banking firm.
In this case the operation cut charges less than could have been
desired, though the other parts of the plan were well-advised. The
intervention of a syndicate has fortunately been usual of late years.
And it is doubtful if the compensation accorded has been exorbitant,
even for the direct services rendered. In 1886 the Reading agreed to
pay a syndicate 5 per cent upon $15,000,000 of subscribed capital,
plus 6 per cent on all money advanced. The Richmond Terminal paid
Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. $100,000 in cash to cover their office expenses
and $750,000 in common stock at $15 per share<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> for their work of
coöperation and supervision. The Union Pacific paid the syndicate
which financed its reorganization $5,000,000 in preferred stock
quoted at 59, or 19 per cent at current prices on a subscribed
capital of $15,000,000. All three syndicates, however, ran the risk
of depreciation in the value of the stock given them, and all three
rendered great service in providing large sums of cash at a time when
capital was not readily to be obtained.</p>

<p>Payments to bankers or trust companies receiving deposits of bonds
and stocks and undertaking the clerical work of a reorganization,
should be sharply distinguished from those made to underwriting
syndicates above described. Depositaries assume no risk, and are
paid a definite sum for definite services performed. In 1895 the
Erie set the compensation of Messrs. J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. and J. S.
Morgan &amp; Co., for their services as depositaries and in carrying out
the plan of reorganization, at $500,000 in addition to all expenses
incurred; and the same year the Union Pacific allowed $1,000,000
in preferred stock to the bankers who managed its underwriting
syndicate, as against $5,000,000 to the syndicate itself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span> It should
be said that the compensation to depositaries is in part payment
for the use of the name of the firms employed as well as in part
payment for clerical work performed. Bondholders are more ready to
deposit their securities with a well-known house than with an obscure
one; and are to some extent influenced by the implied approval of
the reorganization plan which acceptance of deposits by such houses
involves.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the ordinary reorganization, then, creditors,
stockholders, syndicate, and corporation find themselves face to
face. The interests of the syndicate and of the corporation most
nearly coincide except in so far as the syndicate is an owner of
stocks or bonds. The syndicate desires a radical reorganization,—the
corporation requires it. But as between stock- and bondholders and
the corporation; between the stockholders and the bondholders; or
between the junior and the senior bondholders; there is well-nigh
complete antagonism. The corporation, to repeat, needs a reduction in
the fixed charges which it has to pay. The securityholders wish to
lose as little as possible. The stockholders hope to force sacrifices
from the bondholders, and the bondholders to levy a heavy assessment
upon the stock. The junior bondholders call upon their seniors to
bear their part; and the seniors reply that they are well secured and
that the juniors and the stock must take care of themselves.</p>

<p>The first question which arises is that of the cash requirements.
How much cash must be raised to pay off the floating debt, and how
much working cash capital will the new corporation require? It is
almost always true that a large floating debt has accumulated prior
to reorganization. The Northern Pacific in 1893 had a gross debt of
no less than $15,000,000; the Reading in 1895 one of $13,800,000;
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in 1896 one of $13,000,000; the Atchison in
1893 one of $16,000,000. In part this means simply the accumulation
of unpaid bills. In part, however, it represents promissory notes or
other short time paper which the corporation has issued, generally
to pay current indebtedness, but occasionally for financing somewhat
extensive operations. Thus Mr. McLeod carried his purchases of New
England railroad stock by means of advances from brokers, and the
Government Directors of the Union Pacific reported that $15,000,000
out of $21,400,000 of floating debt of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span> that road in 1891 were the
result of expenditure and advances in the construction of branch or
tributary lines. The cost of carrying such indebtedness is naturally
high. Mr. McLeod is reported to have paid an average of 9 per cent
for his loans. The reorganization committee of the Atchison stated
in 1895 that during the five years preceding, the road had paid
over $1,100,000 in discounts and commissions to secure the renewal
of $9,000,000 of guarantee fund notes. And floating indebtedness is
by far the most dangerous as well as the easiest sort of obligation
to incur. It represents a possible demand for large sums of cash on
short notice which even a solvent company may find it impossible to
meet;—a demand, moreover, which is likely to be made at a moment
of stringency in the money market. For this reason, and on account
of the high interest demanded, corporations endeavor to fund their
floating debts when these reach unwieldy proportions. In 1891 the
Union Pacific authorized three-year 6 per cent notes to the amount of
$24,000,000 to be used in taking up its floating debt. In 1893 the
Northern Pacific authorized $15,000,000 collateral five-year 6 per
cent notes for the same purpose. In each case it was hoped to refund
these short time issues with bonds of longer term when the date of
their maturity should arrive. After a company has been in receivers’
hands, issues of receivers’ certificates are pretty sure to swell
the current liabilities. These, again, may be issued to pay current
bills, or to maintain or to improve the railroad when other resources
prove insufficient. For whatever reason incurred, it is plain that
the problem of the floating debt is a serious one for the creditors
and owners of a bankrupt road to meet. If the provision which they
make is insufficient their company will not regain a safe financial
footing. And if, in addition to cancelling the debt outstanding, they
do not provide a margin for working capital, the company will be
forced to incur new floating debt and their work will have to be done
over again.</p>

<p>In general there are two ways by which cash for floating debt and
working capital can be raised:</p>

<p>(1) By assessment on securityholders. (2) By the sale of securities.</p>

<p>Sales of securities may comprise the sale of securities of the
bankrupt, or of other corporations held in that company’s treasury,
or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span> they may be sales of part of new bond or stock issues reserved
for that purpose. In 1898 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio sold among other
things $3,800,000 of Western Union Telegraph stock held in its
treasury since 1887; while in 1889 the Atchison issued and sold
$12,500,000 general mortgage 4s and $1,250,000 income 5s. When
outside securities are sold the value of which is in no way dependent
upon the prosperity of the road which sells them; and which are such,
moreover, as the selling road can readily spare, this method of
raising capital is open to few objections. Its chief disadvantage is
that the sale is apt to be made at a time when the level of general
prosperity is not high, and the price obtained is therefore apt to
be low. But the question is quite different when the securities
are those of the embarrassed or bankrupt road itself. In this case
the credit of the company and the price of its securities are sure
to be at a low ebb. The initial sacrifice entailed is necessarily
great; while if the securities sold are bonds, as they are almost
sure to be, the company increases its annual interest charge without
receiving an equivalent value in return. If, on the other hand, the
railroad endeavors to prevent a rise in charges by the use of income
bonds or stock, the gain is usually neutralized by the extremely low
price obtained.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> In general we may say that sale of a railroad’s
securities in time of general depression is impossible except at a
ruinous sacrifice; that sales should not be resorted to at all except
when the road’s difficulties are acute rather than chronic, as in
the case of the Reading in 1896; and that when securities are to be
sold the best of the available bond issues should be used and not the
worst.</p>

<p>The case of an assessment is very different. Securities may be
sold to outsiders or to present securityholders. In the one event
no pressure at all can be brought to bear; in the other only that
of the indirect loss which the difficulties of the reorganizing
company would involve.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> An assessment, on the other hand, is
levied solely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span> on securityholders and is compulsory. Stockholders
or bondholders who refuse to pay are ordinarily debarred from all
participation in the reorganization, and lose all chance to recoup
their losses from their share in subsequent prosperity. In return for
the assessment some security is usually given, so that from one point
of view an assessment and a sale resemble each other. But the element
of compulsion appears in this: namely, that in the case of a sale the
new securities are taken at the buyers’ valuation; but in the case of
an assessment the company determines what it shall give for the cash
paid in. Hence the usual compensation for an assessment is an equal
nominal amount of preferred stock;—while that for the purchase money
in a sale is a greater nominal amount in bonds. Either an assessment
or a sale of securities may be fortified by a syndicate guarantee.
In the one case the syndicate agrees to substitute itself for all
non-assenting or defaulting stock- or junior bondholders; in the
other it engages to take and dispose of the new securities offered,
or such part of them as the company is unable to sell. The advantages
of syndicate assistance we have already discussed.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that both assessments and sales of securities
have been freely employed in the reorganizations which have been
considered, and that syndicate guarantees have been of ordinary
occurrence. Out of eighteen reorganizations, fourteen were forced
to pay attention to the raising of cash; the four which did not
consisting of the consolidation of the Union Pacific with the
Kansas Pacific and of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific with its
branch lines in 1880, the income conversion reorganization of the
Atchison in 1892, and the Rock Island reorganization of 1902,—each
a reorganization of a more or less peculiar nature. Of the fourteen
remaining, four provided cash by assessment, three by the issue of
securities, and five by a combination of both methods. Adding to
this the Northern Pacific reorganization of 1896 and that of the
Erie in 1859, which combined an assessment with funding provisions,
we have eleven reorganizations which relied on assessments in whole
or in part. This preponderance is, however, due to the extensive use
of assessments from 1893 to 1898; since the earlier reorganizations
show assessments in only about one-half of the cases. This does not
mean that the value of an assessment was not understood before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span> 1893.
For the reorganization of the Northern Pacific in 1895 was otherwise
so radical that an assessment was less necessary; and that of the
Atchison in 1889 took place at a time when business conditions were
not in general depressed. The effect of widespread depression on the
means employed for raising cash is, however, perfectly clear.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a></p>

<p>Of the reorganizations of 1893 to 1898, to repeat, there was none
which we have considered which did not make use of assessments. The
following table shows the amount and distribution thereof:</p>

<p class="in0">It thus appears that the assessments varied from $7.20 on the
East Tennessee to $20 on Reading common, with less sums on the
preferred stock and the junior securities.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> The real sacrifice
demanded of the stockholders is ascertained by deducting from the
above the value of securities given for assessments whenever such
were allowed. Taking for the purpose the market quotations of
these securities six months after actual reorganization, that is,
after the sale of the road, or the putting into effect of the plan
proposed, it appears that the common stock of the Atchison received
$1.90; that of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio $15.20; that of the Richmond
Terminal $5.02; that of the East Tennessee $3.55; and that of the
Union Pacific $8.10. The Erie, the Northern Pacific, and the Reading
gave nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span> for assessments in the nineties.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> Preferred
stock, whenever assessed, received the same relative amount and
kind of securities for assessment as did the common stock, and the
same is true of the junior securities. Since, however, these new
securities had but a prospective value at the time of the issue of
the various reorganization plans, it is advisable to make no attempt
to determine precisely the net assessment, and to call attention to
their allowance merely as a fact on which the stockholders could rely
as they could count on a future rise in the value of their shares.
With this qualification the relative height of assessments and stock
quotations one month after the publication of each reorganization
plan, and six months after the completion of each reorganization may
be given.</p>

In every case during the nineties the amount of assessment exceeded
the sum for which common shareholders could have sold their stock
one month after the publication of the reorganization plan. The
difference ranged from $3.50 for the Erie to $17⅔ for the Reading;
in other words the assessments wiped out the whole value remaining
to common stockholders, and exacted an additional contribution as
the price of participation in any future prosperity. In the case of
the preferred stock, where values were greater and assessments less
heavy, the results were not the same; but even here the proportional
demand was large, and amounted to 100 per cent of current quotations
in the case of the Northern Pacific. Before 1893 assessments were
fewer in number and not so great in amount. It is to the subsequent
rise in stock quotations to which we must turn for an explanation of
the willingness of stockholders to contribute such heavy sums. The
assessments, we find, did not come out of the stockholders’ pockets
in the end; for their payment, in connection with other features of
reorganization, so enhanced the value of shares that only six months
after reorganization the price of stocks in all cases was nearly
equal to the assessment plus the previous market quotation. In some
instances, such as the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, the sum amounted to much
more than this total.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> Refusal to pay would have wiped out the
stockholder’s interest and have kept him from benefiting from the
rise. It is needless to add that quotations to-day are many times the
amount of the assessments. The increase in value has occurred alike
for common and preferred stock, even in times of severe depression.
On the whole, it has abundantly justified the payments which
stockholders were asked to make.</p>

<p>The use of assessments alone represents the most radical and the
soundest method of raising cash. It disposes of the accumulated quick
liabilities once and for all; and involves no subsequent increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
in interest charges. It was the method of the Atchison and the Union
Pacific after 1893, of the Reading from 1883–6, and of the Erie from
1875–7. It was furthermore the method of the Western, New York &amp;
Pennsylvania in 1893,<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> of the Norfolk &amp; Western in 1896,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> and
of other railroads which might be named. Probably its most drastic
application was in the case of the Houston &amp; Texas Central in 1887,
where an assessment of 73 per cent was found necessary to discharge
the floating debt and to provide cash payments for interest and bonus
to first mortgage bondholders, and to pay the charges, expenses, and
other liabilities made or incurred by the Trust Company.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a></p>

<p>The sale of securities also has been relied upon for the production
of cash. The most striking example of the use of securities alone
is afforded by the Reading reorganization of 1883, which at the
same time illustrates the possible unsoundness of the method. The
floating debt of the Reading companies amounted in June, 1880, to
$12,155,248, the bulk having been incurred in attempts to maintain
solvency. To cover this Mr. Gowen proposed an issue of $34,300,000
deferred income bonds,<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> to be sold at 30 per cent of their par
value, and to be entitled to dividends after 6 per cent had been paid
on the common stock. These securities were practically worthless,
and had to be set aside in favor, first, of new general mortgage
bonds, and then of old unissued general mortgage 7 per cent bonds
which the company happened to have in its treasury. So ineffective
was even this expedient that in October, 1884, the floating debt
amounted to a sum nearly one-third greater than that reported in
1880. Another example was the Erie scheme of 1886, which was not,
however, a reorganization, according to our definition. The floating
debt of the Erie in September, 1884, amounted to $5,455,338, of which
$1,007,922 consisted of unpaid coupons. On the suggestion of English
securityholders these coupons were funded; and the balance was raised
by a new terminal mortgage issued and disposed of by a subsidiary
terminal corporation known as the Long Dock Company. The result was
an increase in fixed charges, which contributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span> final failure
in 1893. The history of the Southern Railway affords a third example.
At the end of 1888 the Richmond &amp; West Point Terminal Railway &amp;
Warehouse Company found itself with a floating debt of $5,000,000,
and proceeded to authorize an issue of $24,300,000 5 per cent 25-year
collateral trust bonds, of which $5,000,000 were to be sold to cancel
this indebtedness. In subsequent years the current liabilities again
increased, and for this and other reasons a general reorganization
became necessary, in which both an assessment and a sale of
securities were required. On the whole the result of experience
bears out the statement as to the unsoundness of reliance on the
issue of securities for cash even when the sale of the securities is
guaranteed.</p>

<p>Yet another method of raising cash has been the combination of
assessments with the sale of bonds or stock or both. In 1898 the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio disposed of $3,800,000 Western Union Telegraph
stock. It also provided a total of $37,900,000 prior lien and first
mortgage bonds and preferred stock, which was in part given for
assessments, and in part turned over to a syndicate in return for
cash. The Erie, in 1895, besides its assessment sold $15,000,000 in
prior lien bonds; while the Reading sold $4,000,000 in new general
mortgage bonds and $8,000,000 in new first preferred stock. In each
case the success of the sale was ensured by a syndicate agreement.
In 1886, to go outside of the reorganizations which have been
particularly described, the Texas &amp; Pacific provided funds with which
to cancel a part of its floating debt by an assessment of $10 and an
issue of $6,500,000 common stock. Three years later, the St. Louis,
Arkansas &amp; Texas assessed its second mortgage bondholders 5 per cent
and its stock 10 per cent and sold securities to the par value of
$4,490,880 to cover $3,400,000 of cash requirements.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> In 1894 the
New York &amp; New England issued $4,355,000 in securities and levied
$20 and $25 respectively upon its common and preferred shares.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a>
In 1896 the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco planned to raise $821,410 by
assessment and $5,500,000 by sale of securities. Such examples might
be multiplied indefinitely.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a></p>

The problem of cash requirements must be met and solved before
the parties interested can consider the fixed charges. It is the
reduction in charges, nevertheless, which is usually of the more
fundamental importance. A floating debt accumulated through inability
to pay current expenses is the direct result of excessive charges,
and a settlement which did not lower these, as well as pay off the
debt, could give but temporary relief. Only when failure has been
due to special causes can a decrease in the annual burden be even a
matter for debate. The following tables show the absolute changes
brought about by those of the reorganizations earlier considered for
which precise figures are available:</p>

From these tables, it appears that each of the reorganizations from
1893–8 occasioned an absolute reduction in fixed charges which varied
from 5.92 per cent in the case of the Erie to 51.04 per cent in that
of the Northern Pacific. On the other hand the reductions in the
earlier reorganizations were more irregular and were exceeded by the
increases.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> Absolute figures, however, reveal little. Charges
may be reduced and the road be worse off than before because of more
than proportional reductions in mileage or in earnings. The preceding
table must therefore be supplemented by one showing the changes in
charges per mile of road and changes in the relations of charges to
earnings.</p>

These tables show plainly that substantial reduction in fixed charges
was the rule in the reorganizations of 1893–8, though less universal
and less important in the reorganizations before that date. Even
before 1893, however, the fact that reductions must be made was
apparent. Three reorganizations increased absolute charges instead of
decreasing them. Of these the Atchison reorganization of 1892 was not
due to lack of prosperity, and the Erie reorganization was a failure.
The Reading reorganization of 1880 increased absolute charges,
increased mileage more than correspondingly, but was also a failure.
And it is significant that only those roads which generously reduced
charges regained even a temporary prosperity.</p>

<p>The distribution of losses which a reduction in fixed charges
requires can best be made by a comprehensive redistribution of
securities. All the bonds and stocks which are to suffer must be
called in; and varying amounts of new securities must be given in
their place. Among the important considerations to those who fix the
rates for exchanges are these:</p>

<p>(1) Maximum charges under the new régime should approximate minimum
net earnings under the old.</p>

<p>(2) As large a proportion of the charges as possible should consist
of the one item of interest on bonds.</p>

<p>(3) Losses should fall most heavily on the junior securityholders.</p>

<p>(4) The nominal value of outstanding securities should be reduced as
little as possible.</p>

<p>(5) Bondholders whose claims have been cut down should be afforded
some chance to participate in future increased earnings of the
property.</p>

<p>These rules may be considered in turn. The point to which the best
practice should reduce fixed charges is readily understood. Nothing
less than solvency under the least favorable conditions is the
goal toward which a reorganization plan should strive. It appears,
accordingly, that the minimum earnings of the Atchison property from
1891–4 had been $5,204,880; while the fixed charges proposed for it
were $4,528,547. The lowest net earnings which the Union Pacific had
ever recorded had been $4,315,077. The interest on its new bonded
indebtedness was placed at $4,000,000. The net earnings for the
Northern Pacific in 1895 were $6,052,660, which was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span> least that
the road had earned for eight years. The new fixed charges were
estimated at $6,015,846. The minimum net earnings of the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio from 1887 to 1898 had been $6,610,774. The fixed charges of the
plan of 1898 were set at $6,252,351.</p>

<p>In order to simplify the charges, as well as for other reasons, it
is desirable to have the item of interest bear a large proportion to
the whole. The fixed charges of six of our seven reorganizations from
1893–8 amounted together to $54,562,165. Of this sum, interest on
bonds comprised $35,239,146 or some 64 per cent. The charges of the
same railroads after reorganization amounted to $36,533,040, of which
sum interest on bonds comprised $30,926,638 or 84 per cent.</p>

<p>The distribution of losses should bear most heavily on the junior
securities. The simplest readjustment would seem at first sight
to demand a proportionate concession from all creditors. But this
would be both unjust and impossible. In no sense do all bond- and
stockholders stand upon an equal footing. In the first place, the
cost at which senior bondholders have acquired their claims has
much exceeded the cost at which junior bondholders and stockholders
have acquired securities of equal nominal amount. Apparently equal
claims represent very unequal investment. In the second place this
increased cost has been due to certain legal provisions touching
security which become prominent during reorganization. All mortgage
bonds possess by law a lien upon the property pledged to secure them.
Upon default in repayment of principal, and usually also upon default
in payment of regular interest, their owners have the right to sell
the pledged property at auction and to recoup themselves from the
proceeds. After the underlying bonds have been satisfied the selling
price is applied as far as it will go to the settlement in full of
mortgages in the order of their issue; while the stock, representing
the owners of the property, takes what is left. As a rule a railroad
will not sell for anything like the sum required to pay off all its
mortgages, and the junior issues are threatened with extinction.
Usually, however, it is possible for the junior to guarantee interest
on the senior bonds, or to buy the railroad at foreclosure sale under
some senior mortgage, thus preserving to themselves the benefit of
the earning power of the corporation. When this is done earnings are
distributed according to the relative priority of the various junior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
issues on penalty of still further foreclosure and readjustment. The
principle of reorganization which is followed prescribes because of
this the payment in full of all claims which can be satisfied by the
purchase price of the bankrupt railroad at foreclosure sale, and the
distribution of losses among the remainder according to the relative
priority of their liens.</p>

<p>The consent of securityholders to a reduction in their claim to an
annual return is more easily obtained if the nominal value of their
holdings be little or not at all reduced. There is a magic in the par
value stamped upon a certificate which affords a certain consolation
to those from whom sacrifices in interest are demanded. An unimpaired
principal, moreover, constitutes a real advantage when the date of
maturity arrives. But if the low earning power of the corporation
compels it to ask sacrifices from the holders of its securities, it
is only fair that these sacrifices should cease when the earning
power improves. In other words, it is but just that old bondholders
be given securities upon which payment of interest is optional, so
that they may share in future prosperity, and obtain the same return
which they once enjoyed whenever the road earns enough to pay it.</p>

<p>The foregoing rules dictate the amount of reduction to be made in
charges, and also the kind and amount of new securities which are
usually offered in the exchanges. Interest and rentals must be
cut down without decreasing the nominal value of the securities
outstanding. To reduce interest without reducing nominal value,
either the interest rate on outstanding securities must be lowered,
or mortgage bonds must be replaced by income bonds or by stock. To
reduce rentals annual payments may be arbitrarily cut down, or rental
contracts may be funded into mortgage bonds. These different methods
may be taken up in some detail.</p>

<p>The accompanying tables (see opposite page) show for fourteen
reorganizations the number and amounts of outstanding issues before
and after reorganization at the various rates of interest designated.</p>

<p>Few collections of figures in railway finance deserve more careful
attention than those given in these tables. Whereas the greatest
number of the issues before the seven reorganizations prior to 1893
bore 6 per cent, and the greatest amount outstanding was similarly
at that rate; the overwhelming preponderance in amount after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
reorganizations of 1893–8 bore 4 per cent, and a total of 14.7 per
cent of all the bonds outstanding bore a lower rate of interest than
had appeared at all at the earlier date.</p>

<p>Comparing the total interest with the total bond issue, we find the
average rate to have decreased from 5.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent
by the reorganizations prior to 1893, and from 5.1 per cent to 4.3
per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span> cent by the reorganizations of 1893–8. Of some significance is
a comparison of the rates prior to the reorganizations before 1893
with those subsequent to the reorganizations of 1893–8. The total
interest payable on the issues at the later date was $38,291,319. If
the same proportions of bonds had been issued at the same rates of
interest as before the reorganizations prior to 1893, this interest
would have amounted to $48,552,688. The total interest payable on
the issues before the reorganizations prior to 1893 was $35,658,192.
If the same proportions of bonds had been then outstanding at the
same rates as after the reorganizations of 1893–8 the interest
charge would have been $27,941,807. Thus in the first case there
would have been a saving of $10,261,369 annually, and in the second
case one of $8,279,775. This computation is inexact because it
fails to take account of the normal reduction of interest rates
due to improved credit and to increased prosperity from causes
other than reorganization; but it is included here because, in
the first place, a large part of the reduction was due to actual
reorganization; and in the second place, because much of the improved
credit is attributable indirectly to reductions of charges and other
reorganization features.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that the new bond issues not only bore lower
rates of interest, but were of greater volume and of longer term than
the issues which they replaced. The greater volume is reflected in
the considerable reduction in the number of issues at the same time
that the total amount of bonds outstanding decreased slightly or
increased. Thus the reorganizations before 1893 increased the amount
of bond issues from $645,605,522 to $788,629,515, and decreased
their number from 128 to 98; while the reorganizations of 1893–8
decreased the amount of bonds from $919,836,832 to $881,574,002, and
decreased the number of issues from 189 to 90, or in far greater
proportion.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> The matter may be viewed in another way. Just before
the beginning of the later reorganizations the predominant rate of
interest for the roads concerned was 6 per cent. The number of issues
at 6 per cent outstanding was 85 and the average amount per issue was
$3,540,302. The predominant rate just after those reorganizations was
4 per cent. The number of issues at 4 per cent outstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span> was 16,
and the average amount per issue was $32,544,319. In other words,
the process was to replace numerous small issues which bore high
rates of interest, by a few comprehensive issues at lower rates;
thus simplifying the financial situation, as well as lightening the
burdens which the roads had to bear.</p>

<p>The lengthening of the terms for which the various mortgages were
to run is equally apparent. Before its reorganization in 1897 the
Union Pacific had no mortgage issued for more than 40 years. The
first mortgage of 1897 ran for 50 years. The Reading in 1895 had
four mortgages, all issued during the reorganization of 1888, with
terms of 70 years. All its other mortgages were for shorter periods.
In 1897 it put forth a grand divisional mortgage with a term of 100
years. The Erie in 1894 had two mortgages of 91 years each and one of
84 years, issued during the financial scandals of 1869, but no other
of over $1,000,000 which ran for more than 43 years. Both its prior
lien and its general mortgage bonds now outstanding are to mature 101
years from date of issue. The Atchison in 1889 could boast of only
one mortgage with a term of 51 years. Its reorganization at that time
gave it two of 100 years. The Northern Pacific issued one 100-year
mortgage in the course of its troubles in 1889, and two mortgages
for 101 and 150 years respectively in its reorganization of 1896.
The reason for long terms has been the wish to make new mortgages
attractive. Reorganization mortgages, as has just been said, tend to
be large mortgages, at a lessened rate of interest. They are also
blanket mortgages with an inferior lien. Some inducement besides
the compulsion of necessity is useful in securing the assent of old
bondholders to the proposed exchanges of these bonds for outstanding
securities. The long-term bond protects the holder against the
probable steady fall in the rate of interest on capital. It promises
him advantage in the future in return for surrender in the present.</p>

<p>The reduction in charges by the substitution, for mortgage bonds
with fixed interest, of securities upon which payment of interest
is optional, has been as important as the reduction in the rates of
interest just described. Such securities may be either income bonds
or stock. The income bond has a lien upon railroad property similar
in kind to the lien of an ordinary mortgage. Upon default in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
payment of its principal it can exercise foreclosure rights. But it
has no claim on earnings except in a right to receive dividends out
of net earnings before any dividend shall be paid upon the stock.
Stock certificates control the company by their right to vote,<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a>
but are entitled to its profits only after expenses of every kind
have been met. When divided into preferred and common shares the
former receive preference in dividends and sometimes in voting power.
Among the reorganizations described in the text three made use of
income bonds before 1893 and one after 1893. The amounts of the
issues and the percentages of incomes to total capitalization before
and after the reorganizations were as follows:</p>

<p>The East Tennessee reorganization of 1886 did away with income
bonds, as did that of the Atchison in 1892. It will be noted that
these bonds were more used before 1893, owing probably to the fact
that the name of bond was considered to increase the salability
of a security on the market. Securityholders hesitated to accept
stock, but received bonds without too great a protest. The extent
to which railroads catered to this preference is seen in the case
of the Reading deferred income bonds, on which payment of interest
was deferred to a 6 per cent dividend upon the common stock. From
certain points of view, however, the income bond is inferior to
preferred stock. For instance, preferred stock almost always has
voting power, while income bonds usually have none. And although the
income bondholder is sometimes protected from the insertion of new
claims upon earnings between his bond and the underlying property,
provisions in preferred stock certificates may afford an equal
guarantee. In consequence, the use of income bonds has declined as a
more accurate knowledge of their limitations has become widespread,
and the Atchison adjustment 4s represent the sole use of this
security in our reorganizations from 1893–8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>
The exchange of preferred stock, with or without new bonds, for old
bonds which have borne a fixed interest rate represents the best
current practice. Six of the seven principal railways reorganized
from 1893–8 retired old bonds with fixed interest by new bonds and
preferred stock or by preferred stock alone. Take for illustration
the case of the Erie, which exchanged new general lien bonds and
preferred stock for old second consolidated bonds; of the Northern
Pacific, which exchanged new prior or general lien bonds and
preferred stock for its second and third mortgages; of the Union
Pacific, which gave 4 per cent bonds and preferred stock for its
old first mortgage 6s; exchanges which are but typical of a widely
extended use. Even the Reading, which alone refused so to lighten the
claims upon its earnings, employed preferred stock in retirement of
old first, second, and third income bonds.</p>

<p>These issues were all protected from future introduction of new bonds
between them and their property. The preferred stock certificates of
the Atchison in 1897 contain the following words: “No mortgage, other
than its general and its adjustment mortgage, executed in December,
1895, shall be executed by the company, nor shall the amount of the
preferred stock be increased unless the execution of such mortgage
and such increase of preferred stock shall have received the consent
of the holders of a majority of the whole amount of the preferred
stock which shall at the time be outstanding, given at a meeting of
the stockholders called for that purpose, and the consent of the
holders of a majority of such part of the common stock as shall be
represented at that meeting.” Similar restrictions were imposed by
the Southern in 1893, by the Erie in 1895, by the Northern Pacific in
1896, by the Reading in 1896, and by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in 1898;
or in other words by all the large corporations except the Union
Pacific, whose failures in the nineties we have described.</p>

<p>As for the years before 1893, in them the use of preferred stock
was known, if not so widely resorted to. The East Tennessee in
1886 offered new consols and preferred stock for old consols,
divisional and debenture bonds. In 1881 securityholders of the
Reading proposed, and in 1886 nearly secured, the adoption of plans
which comprised extensive issues of preferred stock in exchange or
in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span> partial exchange for old mortgages. The influence of English
capital, however, and the liking for the name of bond to which we
have referred seems to have prevented large employment of the device.
Where either preferred stock or income bonds were used protection was
afforded. When, in 1875, all the outstanding bonds of the Northern
Pacific were replaced by stock, provision was made for an issue
of first mortgage bonds to an average of $25,000 per mile of road
completed; but no other bonds were to be issued except on a vote of
at least three-fourths of the preferred stock at a meeting specially
held in reference thereto on thirty days’ notice. In the Reading
reorganization of 1886 a clause provided that in calculating the net
earnings from which dividends on income bonds should be paid there
should be deducted from gross profits operating expenses, taxes and
existing rentals, guarantees and interest charges, but not fixed
charges of the same sort subsequently created. And in the case of
the Atchison in 1889 the provision that no bonds could be inserted
between the incomes and the general mortgage 4s was so absolute as to
prove an almost complete bar to new issues.</p>

<p>It is this use of preferred stock and income bonds which makes
it possible to realize the last and highly important rule which
the engineers of exchanges have in mind. Only by the combined use
of securities upon which payment of interest is optional with
securities upon which payment is obligatory can the claims which
their corporations are forced to meet be reduced, while at the same
time former bondholders are given the chance to share in future
prosperity. Such a result is deliberately sought. “The general
theory of adjustment of disturbed bonds,” said the Richmond Terminal
reorganization plan of May, 1893, “has been to substitute for them
the new 5 per cent bonds to such an extent as is warranted by the
earnings and situation of the properties covered by the present
mortgages, and the new preferred stock for the remainder of the
principal.” This purpose receives, moreover, a natural development.
Justice does not demand that old bondholders be given the unlimited
chance at future surpluses which old stockholders should enjoy. Their
former holdings could expect but a fixed amount, and the maximum to
be paid on their new bonds and preferred stock is therefore rightly
restricted. But fair play dictates that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span> be given opportunity
to receive the <em>same</em> income as before. If they must surrender 6 per
cent bonds in exchange for 4 per cent bonds it is equitable to allow
to them as well 50 per cent of their original holdings in new 4 per
cent preferred stock. The corporation thus announces its intention
of saving them unharmed if it can possibly do so, while it insists
that its solvency be not dependent on the success of its attempt.
This idea has been realized in a number of cases with approximate
exactness. The old third mortgage 6 per cent bonds of the Northern
Pacific in 1896 received 118½ per cent in new 3 per cents, 50 per
cent in 4 per cent preferred stock, and 3 per cent in cash,—which
together could yield nearly the same as the old mortgage. The holders
of Chicago Division 5s of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in 1898 surrendered
an annual income of $50 for a chance to receive $50.30; the Union
Pacific first mortgage 6s in 1898 obtained precisely 100 per cent
in new 4 per cent bonds and 50 per cent in new 4 per cent stock. It
would be too much to expect that such exactness should generally
obtain. The variations in security between issues, the well-founded
desire to distinguish and not at the same time to swell unduly the
amount of new stock put forth lead to fluctuations both above and
below the point of equivalence of return. The important fact to
remember is in short this: that the use of bonds with a fixed rate of
interest, together with bonds or stock upon which payment of interest
is optional, provides that compromise between the interests of the
old bondholders and the interests of the corporation which alone can
afford justice to both sides and can allow the reorganization to
proceed.</p>

<p>The matter of rentals may now be considered. “The extent of the
reduction in rentals from reorganization,” says one authority,<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a>
“is seen where the reduction of this item of fixed charges for the
entire country is considered. The net reduction in lease rentals from
1892 to 1898 was $24,527,000, and of this sum $17,768,000 appears
in the South and West where the failures where most numerous and
extensive. The reductions of rentals are most conspicuous in the
Northwest and Pacific coast railroads. It is true that a part of this
decrease in rentals is to be ascribed to the steady movement in the
direction of consolidation which is constantly converting lease into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>
purchase; but coming so close together, the difference between the
figures of 1892 and those of 1898 is sufficiently marked to warrant
the conclusion that most of the reduction is due to the numerous
reorganizations which intervened.”</p>

<p>This conclusion is at first sight borne out by the following tables,
which show the decreases or increases in absolute rentals and
interest for thirteen reorganizations, of which six fall within the
period covered by the quotation:</p>

<p>It appears that while the decrease in rentals was of little
importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span> in the six reorganizations before 1893, it was of great
importance in the reorganizations from 1893 to 1898. Whereas absolute
interest charges were reduced by none of the later reorganizations
by over 40 per cent, four of the railroads cut rentals by over 60
per cent, and two others might have shown a similar result if a
satisfactory division between interest and rentals could have been
made. Unfortunately, both these statistics and Meade’s statement are
open to criticism for the reason which Meade recognized but to which
he did not give sufficient weight. The relative amounts of interest
and of rental paid by a railroad at any time represent the method
by which its system is held together. If a parent company raises
money by the sale of bonds, and purchases its branches outright, or
buys a majority of their shares, its interest charges will be large
and its rentals small; if it leases these same lines its interest
payments will be small and its rentals large. A steady movement in
the direction of consolidation doubtless existed before 1893, but
this movement was certainly accelerated by, and made a prominent
feature of many of the reorganizations of the following five years.
Thus the Northern Pacific in 1893 reported a total length of line
of 5431.92 miles; of which leased lines and lines operated under
contract constituted 1912.92. In 1898, after reorganization and
surrender of the Wisconsin Central, it reported 4524.45 miles owned
and operated, of which 2430.42 consisted of main line, and 2030.82
of branch lines owned. The Erie in 1893 reported 551.12 miles leased
and 598.51 operated for 32 per cent out of a total of 1970.32.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a>
Four years later it either owned outright or held a majority of the
stock of 1806.92 miles out of a total of 2162.81. The Baltimore &amp;
Ohio operated 26.5 per cent of its mileage in 1897 under lease or
contract, but had reduced this by 1899 to .5 per cent. The Southern
Railway proportion was 38.1 per cent in 1892 and 28.4 per cent in
1895. A reduction in rentals through reorganization has occurred, but
a reduction due nevertheless largely to consolidation of systems,
rather than to revision of rental contracts.</p>

<p>It was partly because of the difficulty of exact statement on
the subject that a discussion of rentals was postponed till the
matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span> interest should have been considered. It now appears
that the reduction in interest payments which was so prominent
took place in spite of a reduction in rentals. If, for instance,
the annual interest charges fell $10,261,369 in the course of
all reorganizations, and if in later years the interest figures
represented charges which at earlier date appeared as rentals, then
the real reduction in interest was greater than the figures show. It
is true that consolidation is not responsible for all of that decline
in rentals which has occurred. It is as open to a reorganizing
railroad to continue old leases at easier terms as it is to absorb
the leased roads into its system; and much of this has been done. The
East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia, for instance, leased the Memphis
&amp; Charleston in 1877 for a yearly payment of $297,750; while the
Southern Railway Security Company a few years before had agreed to
pay $318,763.50 annually for the same property. And it is a fact that
both consolidation and direct agreement have been the occasion of
considerable reductions in the payments for the control of subsidiary
lines. There is no reason why leased lines which have not earned
their rentals should not suffer as much as portions of the main
system which have not earned interest on their bonds. On the whole,
then, rentals have decreased, both by means of direct negotiation
and through an absorption of leased roads into the main system
accomplished by exchange of new securities for old. The significance
of precise figures must not be exaggerated. The losses which have
occurred have been distributed according to the same principles which
have already been detailed.</p>

<p>It is now clear that creditors, stockholders, and syndicate in
practically all successful reorganizations agree that cash must be
raised, fixed charges reduced, and the losses distributed according
to the seniority of existing claims; and that of all methods the
comprehensive exchange of new securities for old is best suited
to accomplish at least the last two of these necessities. To give
a comprehensive view of the operations the capitalization after
reorganization of the roads which have been studied may be compared
with the capitalization before. It will then be possible to see at
a glance the consequences of the great variety of exchanges. The
following table gives the percentages which the stock and bonds of
these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span> companies bear before and after reorganization to the total
capitalization before.</p>

per cent for the later period and 14.4 per cent for the earlier.
This reflects the exchange of new securities on which a lower
rate of interest is payable with securities on which all payments
are optional, for old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span> securities which claim a high annual
return. It is the result of the attempt to reduce the demands upon
reorganized corporations without materially reducing the sums
which old securityholders may in times of prosperity receive. It
reflects also, however, the sale of securities for ready cash, or
the exchange of these for assessments, as well as the investment of
minor sums in the improvement of the roads. A closer examination
of the table shows that the increase comes chiefly in bonds before
1893 and in stock after that date. The average increase in bonds
of the seven reorganizations before 1893 was 11.4 per cent and
of common stock .9 per cent; whereas bonds decreased between the
reorganizations of 1893–8 from 65.8 per cent to 59.1 per cent of
the previous capitalization, although common stock increased 9.2
per cent and there was introduced a great volume of preferred stock
which is scarcely found at all before. The less radical nature
of the early reorganizations and the use of income bonds instead
of preferred stock as a security with optional interest are here
apparent. In brief, the statement of capitalization before and after
reorganization summarizes and confirms the conclusions which we have
reached. A few fundamental principles have underlain the complicated
details of the exchanges of new securities for old. These principles
appear when the reorganizations are examined one by one, and they
show not less clearly when all the reorganizations are taken in two
general groups.</p>

<p>Another question now naturally arises. If an increased capitalization
has been obtained without an increase in charges, owing to the
lowering of the rates of bond interest and to the liberal use of
stocks or income bonds, what has been the effect on the market value
of the securities concerned? Is the aggregate value of the new
securities less or greater than the aggregate value of the securities
which they have replaced? It has been seen that taken as a whole less
annual payments can be claimed from the railroads as of right. Has
this fact decreased aggregate quotations, or has the larger volume of
securities and the chance for dividends over and above the minimum
interest, raised such quotations higher than they were before? The
following tables compare the quotations of securities disturbed by
the various reorganizations one year before the failure of their
railroads, with the quotations one year after reorganization of
the new securities issued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span> to exchange for them. A third column is
inserted to show the effects of years of prosperity upon quotations
subsequent to reorganization.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the increased volume of securities of the
reorganizations of 1893–8 sold for a less aggregate price than
did the smaller volume which it replaced. Whereas the disturbed
securities of the seven roads in question, multiplied by their
quotations one year before reorganization, give a product of
$654,394,232, the new bonds and stock given for the disturbed
securities, multiplied by their quotations one year after
reorganization, give a product of $548,027,663.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> This is not true
for three of the four reorganizations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span> before 1893, and it is not
true for the reorganizations of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and of the Union
Pacific in the later period. Individual causes account for most of
the difference. The Reading reorganization of 1886–8 took place so
soon after the previous failure that our method makes it necessary
to take the quotations of securities “before reorganization” only
five days after the railroad has left receivers’ hands. These figures
are therefore unduly depressed. The Atchison reorganization of
1892 was voluntary, and was not caused by financial difficulties.
The reorganizations of the Union Pacific and of the Reading in
1897 and 1898 respectively occurred later than most of the other
reorganizations and benefited from the sharp increase in stock and
bond quotations which began in 1897. For the seven reorganizations
of 1893–8, to repeat, the aggregate market value of old securities
before reorganization was greater than the market value after
reorganization of the new securities given in exchange for them. The
smallest changes took place in the senior securities. In the case of
the Northern Pacific the aggregate value of the three prior mortgages
disturbed increased from $85,498,685 one year before failure to
$86,158,702 one year after foreclosure; while the consolidated
or blanket mortgage of the company decreased from $36,032,360 to
$29,235,111. In the case of the Reading the value of the general
mortgage 4s increased from $37,160,977 to $37,383,503, while the
first, second, and third income bonds decreased from $32,353,497
to $22,784,700. The reason was not generally a smaller increase in
volume, but the fact that new bonds of fairly stable value were given
for the better sorts of old securities, while old junior mortgages
were apt to receive new income bonds or preferred stock, of which the
value varied within wide limits.</p>

<p>The wide difference in the nature of the securities of the different
roads forbids any attempt at precise classification. The following
divisions may, however, be made: Three of the reorganizations
from 1893–8 retired branch-line bonds for which quotations are
obtainable, with a resultant increase in value for the issues of
$3,256,127, or 14.2 per cent. Five of the reorganizations dealt with
what may be classed as general mortgage bonds, and the value of the
new securities given was to the value of the old as $182,160,406
to $196,186,382, or a decrease of 7.1 per cent. Three of the
reorganizations retired junior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span> bonds other than income. The value of
the old securities was $47,874,648 and that of the new $22,272,174,
or a decrease of 53.6 per cent. Four of the reorganizations retired
income bonds. The value of the old securities was $40,913,662, the
value of the new was $28,177,721, and the decrease was 31.1 per cent.
Three of the reorganizations retired old preferred stock, and reduced
the aggregate market value from $36,509,662 to $13,825,138, or 62.1
per cent. Finally, the common stock decreased 21.3 per cent from an
aggregate value of $125,160,409 to one of $98,316,060. Stated in
tabular form the result is as follows:</p>

<p>This makes more definite the conclusion which has been outlined in
general terms before. The burden of the reorganizations from 1893–8
fell on the junior securities and stockholders. The holders of prior
lien bonds actually had more value than before one year only after
reorganization had taken place; the general mortgage bondholders had
nearly recouped their losses; while the former position of the other
creditors and of the stockholders was far from being regained.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the decreases in market quotations were
due to a general decline in prices of securities and not to
reorganizations of the roads in question. This objection, however,
cannot hold. It is true that a general decline began in the United
States in February, 1893, and continued through 1894, reaching its
lowest point in August, 1893, and, after that, in March, 1895;
and that this decline was due to general conditions of panic and
depression. In 1895, however, a revival took place, and, proceeding
with uncertain steps through 1896, became obvious and important in
1897 and 1898. The average date of failure from 1893–8 of the seven
roads described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span> in the text was October 1, 1893, and the average
date of reorganization was September 1, 1896. Since the market price
figures quoted are taken one year before failure and one year after
reorganization, conditions in October, 1892, should be compared with
those in September, 1897. The following diagram traces the movements
of twenty-six important railroad common stocks between those
dates. Quotations for none of the seven railroads in question are
included.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">
<img src="images/i_378.jpg" width="511" height="229" alt="Prices for 26 railroad common stocks" />
</div>

<p>It is evident that the prices of the above stocks were not materially
lower on September 1, 1897, than on October 1, 1892. The exact
average was 73¾ for the earlier month, and 71⅛ for the later. The
comparison may fairly, however, be carried further than this, and
considerable pains have been taken to arrive at general figures
which are conclusive. Such, it is believed, are the following. The
market value of thirty-nine different bond issues of seventeen
companies, taken at random from among those frequently bought and
sold upon the New York and Philadelphia exchanges, was in October,
1892, $388,628,968. This differed little from the market value of
the same securities in September, 1892, which was $388,198,432, or
that in November, 1892, which was $390,170,323. The market value of
these issues in 1897 was $371,125,135 in August, $373,875,293 in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
September, and $372,962,239 in October. Represented in tabular form

<p>In other words, the quotations for this large mass of representative
securities were within 4½ per cent in 1897 of what they were in 1892.

<p>This is, as nearly as possible, a computation comparable with figures
already cited. It is made up the same way, has too broad a basis to
give a non-typical result, and is not dependent upon the selection
of a single month for its conclusion that security prices had nearly
regained their former level by the last half of 1897. A decrease
in value of 16.2 per cent for the securities of seven reorganized
railroads has been determined. Less than one-fifth of this can be
attributed to general causes. The significance of the decrease
therefore remains.</p>

<p>In conclusion, two other points of interest may be mentioned. First,
the provision which sound reorganization plans should make for the
future development of their properties, and second, the creation
of voting trusts to prevent sudden changes in control. It has been
seen that restrictions on new mortgages have accompanied the issue
of income bonds and of preferred stock, in order to afford to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span> these
latter a desirable protection. If old bondholders demand these
clauses, a certain amount of new issues is required by the interests
of the corporation. A railroad is never finished. New extensions and
improvements which shall increase earnings are generally called for
to a degree which current earnings are insufficient to meet. Some
provision for regular increments of new capital, without the need of
stockholders’ approval in each case, is highly advisable, and implies
no lack of conservatism. In fact, some such provision is often forced
upon a railroad. Take the case of the successive reorganizations of
the Atchison properties. In 1889 no new bonds were to be allowed
to be inserted between the income and the mortgage issues, but it
was left optional with the management to deduct all improvements
before estimating the earnings applicable to dividends on the former
bonds. This proved quite inadequate, and the reorganization of 1892
provided definitely a fund of $20,000,000 second mortgage bonds,
which were to be issued to a limit of $5,000,000 each year, for
specific improvements on the Atchison, exclusive of the Colorado
Midland and the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco. The right was reserved to
the company, when all the above should have been used up, to issue
more bonds of the same sort for the same purpose, and on the same
mileage up to a limit of $50,000,000. Finally, in 1895, there were
reserved $30,000,000 general first mortgage bonds, to be issued
each year to a limit of $3,000,000, and $20,000,000 adjustment
bonds, to be issued each year to a limit of $2,000,000, after the
general mortgage fund should have been exhausted. In each of the
reorganizations in the nineties considered in this study, in which
restrictions on new bond issues were imposed, there was concomitant
provision for regular increments of mortgage bonds to be used for
improvements, betterments, and new construction. Thus the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio in 1898 reserved $5,000,000 prior liens and $27,000,000
general mortgage bonds, of which the latter were to be issued at the
rate of not exceeding $1,500,000 for the first four years after the
organization of the new company, and not exceeding $1,000,000 a year
thereafter; and the former were to be put forth at the rate of not
exceeding $1,000,000 a year after January 1, 1892, for enlargements,
betterments, and extensions. The Erie in 1895 provided $5,337,208
in cash to be spent at once, and $17,000,000 in general lien bonds
to be issued during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span> years following the reorganization. The
Northern Pacific in 1896 set aside $25,000,000 prior lien bonds,
of which not more than $1,500,000 were to be issued in any one
year, and $4,000,000 general lien bonds, presumably to be used as
needed. The Reading in 1895 reserved $20,000,000 general mortgage
bonds for new construction, additions, and betterments, of which not
over $1,500,000 were to be used in any one year. And, finally, the
Richmond Terminal reserved $20,000,000 in 5 per cent bonds to be used
at the rate of $2,000,000 per year, and has recently authorized a
$200,000,000 4 per cent mortgage which will raise the yearly limit of
expenditure to $5,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a></p>

<p>Before the nineties, as after, provision for new capital accompanied
restriction on the future issue of bonds. In 1886 the Reading
provided a lump sum of $9,792,000 general mortgage bonds for future
use in the improvement of the railroad; and in 1875 the Northern
Pacific contemplated the issue of first mortgage bonds to an average
of $25,000 per mile of new road actually completed. Where, as with
the Atchison in 1889, some such provision did not accompany the
general restrictions placed upon new bond issues, or where, as with
the Northern Pacific in 1875, the provision proved inadequate, fresh
measures of relief were compelled. The Atchison reorganization
of 1892 has been mentioned; in 1889 a financial operation of the
Northern Pacific, which according to our definition was not properly
a reorganization, provided $20,000,000 5 per cent consolidated
mortgage bonds for additional branches at a rate not to exceed
$30,000 per mile, and a like sum for betterments, etc.</p>

<p>Even where no restrictions on future bond issues are imposed, it is
highly advisable that some provision for future capital requirements
be made, and that the management have at its disposal a fund of
bonds issuable without the approval of stockholders in each case.
It is probable, therefore, that some such provision would have been
a feature of some, at least, of the reorganizations even had the
restrictions described not made the clauses an imperative necessity;
but if we may judge from the rather restricted basis on which we
are here at work, the provisions would have been far less liberal
than we have found to be the case. In 1895 the Union Pacific set
aside $13,000,000 4 per cent bonds and $7,000,000 preferred stock
to dispose of equipment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span> obligations, and for reorganization and
corporate uses. Of these, corporate uses were stated to be those
which would be proper to the corporation thereafter, such as the
issue of securities in extension of the property. This, of course,
was quite inadequate. Similarly the Rock Island in 1902 and the
Erie in 1875–7 provided for a certain issue of stock or bonds to be
applied to future capital requirements. It is undoubtedly true that
both the Erie and the Reading railroads were hampered by the lack of
adequate provision of this nature; though as the main difficulty of
each corporation was the continued existence of heavier charges than
it could bear, an automatic increase of indebtedness would not have
proved a solution of their troubles.</p>

<p>The essence of a voting trust is the deposit of stock in the hands
of trustees (most frequently five in number). These trustees issue
certificates in return. All dividends declared on the stock are
paid over to holders of certificates, but all the voting power is
exercised by the trustees so long as the trust endures. Of the
reorganizations which we have described, ten reorganizations with
foreclosure included five voting trusts and one proxy committee;
eight reorganizations without foreclosure included two voting trusts;
ten reorganizations before 1893 included two voting trusts (though a
third was proposed for the Atchison in 1889); seven reorganizations
in 1893–8 included five voting trusts and one proxy committee. The
use of voting trusts has therefore become more general, denoting a
realization of the dangers of fluctuating and speculative control
at critical periods in a railroad’s history. This desire to secure
conditions of stable control has been the dominant one in the cases
under consideration. “In order to establish such control of the
reorganized company for a series of years,” said the reorganization
plan of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in 1898, “both classes of stock of
the new company shall be vested in ... five voting trustees.” “The
importance of vesting in the present creditor class the management
of the properties until their productiveness is considerably
increased ... is manifest,” said the syndicate reorganization
plan of the Reading in 1886. It is of supreme importance that a
reorganized company be well started on its way by men who have an
interest in making the reorganization plan permanently successful,
and that conservative direction be assured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span> until danger of
bankruptcy be past. For this reason we should expect the use of
voting trusts to increase in direct relation to the seriousness of
the difficulties experienced, and to the vividness with which the
need for stability is felt. If we may generalize, and say that a
railroad which cannot be reorganized without a foreclosure sale is
usually in more desperate straits than one which can be saved by
voluntary concessions, we have an explanation of the coincidence of
foreclosures and voting trusts. The teachings of experience, which
have shown both the usefulness of voting trusts as tools, and the
necessity of a solution such as they offer, further explain the
increased prominence of the trust in later years.</p>

<p>It is not true that voting trusts are always used for the purposes
indicated. In 1892 certain stockholders of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
agreed to deposit their certificates in a trust for one year and
five months. The stock deposited amounted to $8,975,000 out of a
total outstanding of $25,000,000, and a limit of $11,000,000 was
set to the amount to be so placed, the object of the arrangement
apparently being to increase the influence of the stockholders
concerned by concentration of their holdings.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> Again, in
1895, to take an outside example, the stock of the Oregon Railway
&amp; Navigation Company was placed in trust with the Central Trust
Company in order better to protect the preferred stock. It was
provided that during the continuance of the trust the Central Trust
Company should vote all the stock: first, against any increase in
the preferred stock unless the holders of all the voting trust
certificates of both classes should give their unanimous consent at
general meetings; second, against all propositions relating to the
mortgaging, selling, or leasing of the railroad and telegraph lines
of the company, or to the consolidation thereof, unless a majority
of each class of certificates should consent; third, on all other
questions as directed by the holders of a majority of the aggregate
of all voting trust certificates of both classes represented at
general meetings.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> Further provisions gave to the preferred stock
control of a majority of the board of directors. These instances are
of interest; but the principal purpose of the voting trusts in the
reorganizations which we have considered has been nevertheless the
securing of stability of control for a definite period after the
rehabilitation of the bankrupt companies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
The duration of the voting trust varies from company to company.
The most usual provision is for five years. Frequently the voting
trustees may terminate the trust earlier at their discretion, as in
the case of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio trust of 1898, the Richmond Terminal
trust of 1894, or the Northern Pacific trust of 1896. Frequently,
also, certain conditions must be fulfilled before termination. In
the case of the Erie in 1895 no stock certificates were to be due or
deliverable before December 1, 1900, nor until the expiration of such
further period, if any, as should elapse before the Erie Railroad
Company in one year should have paid 4 per cent cash dividend on the
first preferred stock.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> In the case of the Reading in 1896 4
per cent cash dividends on the first preferred stock were required
for two consecutive years, and this delayed dissolution three years
beyond the time originally contemplated.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> The Richmond Terminal
trust had provisions similar to those of the Erie.</p>

<p>The number of trustees also varies. The scheme proposed for the
Atchison in 1889 contemplated a trust of seven; the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
in 1898 and the Richmond Terminal in 1894 provided for five; and
the Erie in 1896 for three; but this point is not material. When
the reorganization plan requires the consent of stockholders to an
increase in the issue of securities the consent of holders of trust
certificates is apt to be required on similar occasions during the
existence of the trust. Thus the Northern Pacific agreement of 1896
forbade the trustees to increase the preferred stock or to issue any
new mortgage, except with the consent of the holders of a majority
of the whole amount of preferred stock trust certificates, and of
the holders of a majority of the common stock trust certificates
represented at the meeting.</p>

<p>This ends the present treatment of the subject of railroad
reorganization. The results of the discussion may be briefly summed
up as follows:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> Reorganization is most frequently an attempt to extricate an
embarrassed company from its difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> These difficulties can generally be traced either to an
unrestricted freedom of capitalization, or to destructive competition.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The shape in which trouble appears is likely to be that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>
a large floating debt or of excessive fixed charges; either or both
of which may have brought the corporation to a critical condition
some time before the actual collapse.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The best practice favors the retirement of floating debt
by assessments on securityholders, though sales of securities are
sometimes resorted to, or a combination of sales and assessments is
employed.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> Fixed charges are composed chiefly of interest and rentals.
Interest payments are reduced by the retirement of outstanding bonds
by new bonds which bear a lower rate of interest, or by income bonds
or stock, or by a combination of securities with a fixed rate of
interest with securities upon which payment of interest is optional.
Rentals may be reduced by direct negotiation, or the leased roads may
be absorbed into the main system, and their securityholders receive
new stocks and bonds as above.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> The new bonds are of fewer kinds and have longer terms to
run than the bonds which they displace.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i> This reduction in fixed charges imposes a loss on the
greater part of securityholders, both in respect to the annual
interest which they can claim, and in respect to the selling price of
their holdings. A similar loss is suffered by those securityholders
who pay the required assessments.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i> The loss falls on securityholders according to the
seniority of their holdings,—those bonds escaping which can expect
to satisfy their claims from the selling price of the railroad at
foreclosure sale.</p>

<p><i>Ninth.</i> The most important development in reorganization practice
has been the increasing use of new securities bearing a fixed rate
of interest with new securities bearing a conditional rate of
interest; a use which may make the losses of junior securityholders
temporary instead of permanent, and yet safeguard the interests of
the corporation. In this connection preferred stock has gained in
popularity over income bonds.</p>

<p><i>Tenth.</i> This development, and the issue of new securities for
floating debt and for other purposes, have caused the capitalization
after reorganization in all but one of the cases which we have
examined to exceed the capitalization before.</p>

<p><i>Eleventh.</i> In order to perfect a reorganization additional
provisions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span> are often inserted, which protect junior securityholders
against the reckless issue of new bonds, supply the corporation
with ability to make necessary betterments from capital account,
protect the corporation from sudden changes in control, and similarly
supplement the main clauses.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="BIBLIOGRAPHICAL_NOTE">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p>Information about railroad reorganization must be gathered from a
wide variety of sources. The most important are five in number.
First, there are the annual reports of the railroads themselves.
Second, there are the files of financial and railroad papers. Third,
there are contemporaneous pamphlets. Fourth, there are memoirs
and biographies containing first-hand material. And fifth, there
are government documents, which comprise (1) regular reports by
and testimony before bodies like the state and national railway
commissions; (2) reports by and testimony taken before occasional
committees; (3) legislative records; (4) state and federal court
proceedings.</p>

<p>Of the five sources mentioned, the files of contemporary papers
are the most useful. The <cite>Commercial and Financial Chronicle</cite>, the
<cite>Railroad Gazette</cite>, the <cite>Railway Age</cite>, the <cite>Railway and Engineering
Review</cite>, the <cite>Railway Times</cite> of London, the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>,
the New York <cite>Journal of Commerce</cite>, the <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>,
and many others are generally accurate and trustworthy, though
it should be noted as a limitation that they seldom have inside
information, and that their comment is not always independent.
These papers are supplemented by pamphlets and circulars. Many
reorganization plans are published in pamphlet form. Opposition to
them is not infrequently thrown into the same shape. Reports of
experts are printed in pamphlets. In general, the live literature
of reorganization must be put out on short notice, and so is issued
in this informal way. The official statistics of railroads are
to be found in the reports of the railroad companies themselves,
made to stockholders or to supervisory government bodies. These
statistics, like the news items in the financial and railroad
papers, must be used with care. They are sometimes incomplete, and
they are sometimes purposely misleading. Nevertheless, they are
useful, and serious inaccuracies in any of them are usually exposed
within a few years after their original publication. The material
to be found in legislative records is not abundant. Railroads
almost invariably, however, appear before the courts in the course
of their reorganizations, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span> the decisions of these tribunals
some facts of interest may be found. The records of the receivership
of the Union Pacific have been published in fourteen volumes. The
decision of the United States Supreme Court in Pearsall <i>vs.</i> Great
Northern<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> blocked the first of the reorganization plans proposed
for the Northern Pacific in 1895. An earlier decision<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> enabled
the Union Pacific to postpone the payment of interest upon the public
debt until the principal should have fallen due. The Erie has been
at times almost continuously before the courts, and the same is true
of the Reading during its reorganizations, of the Northern Pacific,
and of other roads. The student is most fortunate when he can uncover
testimony before government committees, of men who have taken part
in reorganization proceedings, or who are personally acquainted
with developments which have led up to railroad failures. Mr.
Blanchard, before the Hepburn Committee,<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> and Mr. Fink, before
the Hepburn and the Cullom Committees,<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> helped their hearers to
understand the policy which finally resulted in the failure of the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio. The report of the Poland Committee disclosed the
scandal of the Crédit Mobilier.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> The testimony of Gould, Adams,
Ames, Holmes, and others before the United States Pacific Railroad
Commission of 1887–88<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> made clear the iniquity of the Union
Pacific reorganization of 1880. The statements of Mr. Pierce before
the Senate Committee on Pacific Railroads in 1896<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> explained the
attitude of the Union Pacific towards the repayment of that company’s
debt to the Government. The testimony of Messrs. McLeod, Rice,
Harris, and others before the Industrial Commission of 1900 threw
much light upon the Reading bankruptcy of 1893. The arguments of
counsel in the matter of export differentials, reprinted in the fifth
volume of the Elkins Committee report,<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> gave valuable information
on the subject of trunk-line competition. Many of the witnesses
before these committees are frank in criticism of the railroads with
which they have been connected. Others are forced to admissions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span> by
the keen questioning to which they are exposed. The only similar
material to be found elsewhere lies in memoirs, such as those of
Henry Villard,<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> or in biographies like Oberholtzer’s Life of Jay
Cooke<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> and Pearson’s An American Railroad Builder<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> which make
use of private papers of men prominent in railroad finance. Perhaps
White’s Book of Daniel Drew,<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> Depew’s Retrospect of Twenty-Five
Years,<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> and the Life of Isaac Ingalls Stevens by his son,<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a>
should be included in this class.</p>

<p>This enumeration, while in no way exhaustive, indicates the principal
sources from which material may be obtained. Secondary works do not
exist which treat solely of railroad reorganization. There is an
article by E. S. Meade in the <cite>Annals</cite> of the American Academy,<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a>
articles by Simon Sterne in the <cite>Forum</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> and an article by
A. Lansburgh in <cite>Die Bank</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> but no books of which the author
is aware. Mention may be made of an intelligent discussion of an
industrial reorganization by A. S. Dewing in the <cite>Quarterly Journal
of Economics</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> <cite>Poor’s Manual</cite> for 1900 contains the most
convenient set of general statistics. On railroad receiverships,
besides legal works, there is a monograph by H. H. Swain,<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a>
which has a brief bibliography, and articles in the <cite>Forum</cite>, <cite>North
American Review</cite>, and other periodicals.</p>

<p>On the history of the great American railroad systems the literature
is also quite inadequate. The Union Pacific has been written up
frequently, because of its relations with the United States<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Government. Works by Davis,<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> von der Leyen,<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> Bromley,<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a>

phases of the company’s development up to its final reorganization,
an article by Meyer<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> describes the settlements between the
Pacific railroads and the Government, and another article by Mitchell
in the <cite>Quarterly Journal of Economics</cite><a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> deals with Union Pacific
finance since that time. There may also be mentioned an account by
Bailey,<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> which covers the whole of the road’s history, but in
a superficial way, and a vicious attack by Robinson upon all the
government-aided lines.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> The student of the Erie has at his
disposal the elaborate narrative by E. H. Mott,<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> the chapters

<p>These books are of service. Their number is, however, small and their
scope limited. It is surprising that a field so rich as that of the
history of American railroad systems should have attracted so little
attention from competent students. It is not too much to say that the
history of the Erie by Mott is the only comprehensive work of the
kind which our literature possesses, and that is already thirteen
years old.</p>

forced to send all his New York business. Disputes arose over the
proper pro-rating of charges. President Garrett alleged that the
terminal charge of four cents per 100 pounds which the Pennsylvania
Company imposed on freight coming to or going from New York was
exorbitant, and that he was paying for 100 miles of transportation
when the real distance was only 90. President Scott replied that the
rates for terminal services in New York were not sufficient to cover
the cost of doing the business, and that the Pennsylvania’s New York
and Philadelphia line was open to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio on the same
terms as to all others. R. R. Gaz. 7:71–2, 1875.</p></div>

coal. In an interview the last of May or first of June, 1875,
President Garrett said that as soon as the right was conceded to his
road to enter New York over the Pennsylvania Railroad as he had been
doing for thirty years, and to make such rates from Baltimore and
Chicago as he chose, he was ready for peace and not sooner.... The
Saratoga combination, which had been gotten up to ruin the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad, had only served to establish the road and give it
a standing in the West.... It had been and was now his firm object
to maintain the freight rate on fourth class, the principal freight
shipped from the West, at 35 cents per 100. This was a reasonable
rate and gave his company a fair profit. The other lines had to
submit to this rate or there could be no peace. R. R. Gaz. 7:237,

competing points. Each board of directors was to appoint a special
committee to which was to be referred all differences which might
arise. The Pennsylvania opened its lines to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio

other connecting roads at Philadelphia.</p></div>

of loans and bills payable. This is now reduced to $6,446,173.

shops. In addition there should be, in the near future, not less
than $2,000,000 additional put into this property for the purpose
of improvement. The total requirements are thus $10,000,000. Of
this $5,000,000 will be disposed of by assets in the hands of the
syndicate as collateral, or in the hands of the company. Of the
remaining $5,000,000, $1,500,000 is floating debt. This will be more
than provided for by the $2,500,000 of consolidated bonds remaining
in the hands of the company for its future use after the sale of the
$5,000,000 to the syndicate. The remaining $3,500,000 needed for
equipment and improvements it is the desire of the company to provide
for by that portion of the $2,500,000 not required for the floating
debt, and by the $2,500,000 in the sinking-fund loan of 1890. Chron.

against stronger. This had long been a demand of the Grand Trunk, and
had been conceded to it in the last part of 1887. In January, 1888,
the Pennsylvania and the New York Central agreed to allow besides a
differential rate to the Erie, the Lackawanna, the West Shore, and
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, which should vary from five cents per hundred

with this company the Baltimore &amp; Ohio had enjoyed terminal
facilities at Chicago on favorable terms. When the Terminal Railway
went bankrupt the Baltimore &amp; Ohio paid off the first mortgage bonds
in order to prevent the loss of its privileges. Litigation followed,
to end finally in an agreement between the Hill and Baltimore &amp;
Ohio interests for joint ownership of the Chicago Terminal by the
Burlington and the latter, and for the use of its facilities in
accordance with an equitable division of its trackage. The Pere

enough to pay the interest on its bonds, and that a large amount was
due to the state of Tennessee which the company had no present means
of paying. Either an assessment on the stock or a lease to the East
Tennessee was declared to be necessary. Accordingly, a lease was
concluded. The East Tennessee agreed so to discharge the principal
of the company’s indebtedness to the state as to reduce the annual
interest account from $360,000 to $310,000 as a maximum, and upon the
fulfilment of this and of certain other minor conditions took over
the operation of the road. Two years later the lease was extended
for twenty years at a definite rental amounting to 7 per cent on
$4,225,000 or a yearly payment of $295,750. See R. R. Gaz. 9:421,
1877, and Ibid. 11:672, 1879.</p></div>

50,000 and 60,000 shares of stock and other securities of the
Richmond Terminal system, “for the purpose of removing the obstacles
which now stand in the way of a fair and equitable reorganization of

The following is from the plan, section 9: “As an example of the
manner in which accounts have been kept, it may be mentioned that in
the operating expenses of the entire Richmond &amp; Danville system only
$20,000 were charged for renewal of rails in the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1890, and not a dollar in the fiscal years ending June 30,
1891 and 1892, respectively. In seven months under the receivership
(July, 1892, to January, 1893, inclusive) about $600 were charged.
Since that date, it is understood, about $18,000 have been charged.
With these exceptions all renewals of rails were charged to
construction accounts. Renewals, properly to be included in operating
expenses, would be at least $100,000 to $150,000 per annum.” Other
instances, almost as bad, could be stated.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_417" href="#FNanchor_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> This increase in dividend gave rise to sharp and
well-merited criticism. The directors defended their action as
follows:
</p>
<p>
“In forming a just opinion of this matter,” said they, “it is
necessary to recall to the stockholders the statement made in the
circular of July 30, 1887.... It was stated in the circular referred
to that for the six months ending July 1, 1887, the net earnings
exceeded by more than $1,200,000 the net earnings for the first six
months of the year 1886, that the earnings were still increasing,
and what has always been true in the past may be expected this year
also; namely, that the revenue of the second six months of the year
will be considerably in excess of that of the first six months.... It
will ... be seen that ... the year 1887 formed a remarkable exception
to what had hitherto been the regular course of Atchison’s earnings;
the second half of that year showing an increase over the first half
of only $278,096 gross, and $204,144 net.... Drouths, failure of
crops, excessive competition, continually decreasing rates, unwise
legislation, strikes, and other calamities have befallen us as they
have other Western roads; but your directors could not know in
advance that any of these unfavorable conditions would have to be
met, much less that they would all have to be met at one and the same
time.” Annual Report, 1888.
</p>
<p>
This defence was altogether unsatisfactory. An increase in the
dividend rate is too important to be justified by anything but
earnings actually in hand. Moreover, the conditions which the
directors held responsible for the decline in Atchison earnings
were either well known at the time when the dividend was declared,
or could easily have been anticipated. It was even alleged that the
decrease in business which the annual report for 1888 disclosed
was due to lessened carriage of company material to the West for
construction of new track, and not to crop failure or other decline
in general business. See R. R. Gaz. 21:327, 1889.</p></div>

At its final meeting in 1898 the reorganization committee nominated
a proxy committee of five members “to permanently represent, at the
annual and other meetings, such holders of common and preferred stock
as (should) desire to entrust their proxies to the said committee
for the purpose of maintaining the management and general policies

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_537" href="#FNanchor_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> Testimony of Mr. Harriman before the Interstate
Commerce Commission. It is true that the Northern Securities stock
held by the Union Pacific system had been pledged as security for
an equal amount of Oregon Short Line 4 per cent and Participating
4s, and that when these bonds were refunded there was pledged for
the new issue whatever the Union Pacific interests should receive in
exchange for their Northern Securities holdings, and any other shares
or bonds at not exceeding 80 per cent of their appraised value. But
the purchase of the Southern Pacific and of the Northern Pacific
stocks had been previously financed by an issue of convertible
collateral bonds for which other collateral had been pledged. From
1904 on, the rising price of Union Pacific stock made conversion
desirable and rapidly released the securities back of the original
issue. These released securities, with $18,000,000 Southern Pacific
preferred stock paid to the Union Pacific in 1904 (with $2,460,960
cash), proved a sufficient pledge for the Oregon Short Line refunding
bonds, and the Great Northern and Northern Pacific stock shares were
therefore free for other purposes.</p></div>

Wisconsin Central divided its gross earnings into two parts, 65 per
cent and 35 per cent; retained 35 per cent for its own use, and
appropriated 65 per cent for operating expenses and for certain
improvements tending to reduce operating expenses. When operating
expenses were less than 65 per cent the Wisconsin Central was
to pay over one-half of the difference to the Northern Pacific
in consideration of the business which the latter gave it. When
operating expenses exceeded 65 per cent the Wisconsin Central was to
pay not exceeding 2½ per cent of this excess out of its 35 per cent,
and to divide one-half of any excess of operating expenses above
67½ per cent equally between the Wisconsin Central and the Northern
Pacific. The Northern Pacific, however, was not bound to pay its
half of such excess except out of future profits received under the
contract.</p></div>

<p>
“<i>Resolved</i>, That the $3,347,000 of consolidated mortgage bonds now

sell enough to make up the deficiency any year between the dividend
actually paid to preferred stockholders and the 4 per cent which
should be paid.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_627" href="#FNanchor_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> “We are of the opinion,” said Justices Field, Harlan,
and Brewer, “that proceedings to foreclose a mortgage upon lines
extending through more than one district should be commenced in the
Circuit Court in which the principal operating offices are situated,
and in which there is some material part of the railroad embraced by
the mortgage. Such court should be the court of primary jurisdiction.
But in view of the fact that a portion of the line of road owned by
the Northern Pacific Company is within the State of Wisconsin, and
that at the time of the filing of the creditors’ bill the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company was operating a road through the Eastern
District of Wisconsin, although such road was under lease to it for
99 years; and in view of the further fact that the railroad company
assented to the action of the Circuit Court for the Eastern District
of Wisconsin in taking jurisdiction, and as such jurisdiction has
been recognized by the Circuit Court in every district ... for the
space of about two years, we are of the opinion that the Circuit
Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin has jurisdiction to
proceed to a decree of foreclosure which will bind the mortgagor
company and the mortgaged property, and ought to be recognized by
the Circuit Court of every district along the line as the court of
primary jurisdiction.” Chron. 62:234, 1896.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_681" href="#FNanchor_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> The lien of a floating debt is inferior to that of a
bond when unsecured, except as it represents arrears of wages and

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_682" href="#FNanchor_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> In the case of the Rock Island in 1902 there was no
floating debt to be considered, while in 1885 the Erie funded overdue
coupons and issued a 6 per cent mortgage on its Jersey City terminals
to cover accumulated liabilities, but did not disturb its outstanding
mortgage bonds, and cannot, therefore, be said to have reorganized.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_683" href="#FNanchor_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> This was, in fact, a prominent feature of the
reorganizations between 1893 and 1898. The Atchison surrendered
the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco; the Erie absorbed the New York,
Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio into its system instead of continuing the lease
thereof; the Northern Pacific surrendered the lease of the Wisconsin
Central and cancelled various unprofitable traffic contracts and
traffic agreements; the Reading gave up the Lehigh Valley and its
New England extensions; the Southern reduced its mileage by over
one-half; and the Union Pacific shrunk from 7674 miles in 1892 to
5399 in 1899.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_687" href="#FNanchor_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> In the case of the Atchison, old income bonds were

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_690" href="#FNanchor_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> The percentages for the Atchison are corrected
according to the report of Mr. Little. Owing to the lack of available
detail it has been necessary to increase operating expenses by the
total amount of the errors which he discovered, and this figure is,
therefore, unduly inflated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_691" href="#FNanchor_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> In 1893, after the Northern Pacific failure, the
consolidated 5 per cent bondholders formed a committee; Mr. Brayton
Ives invited bondholders to send in their names and addresses to him
(1894); and later in 1894 the falling off in the railroad’s earnings
induced the formation of the Livingston and Van Nostrand committees,
and the announcement of the consolidated committee that it would
accept the deposit of second and third mortgage bonds. Finally,
within four months after the Atchison failure of 1893, four important
reorganization committees were asking for deposits in the United
States and one was soliciting deposits in London.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_692" href="#FNanchor_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> The officers of bankrupt roads have no need of
committees to make their wishes known, but only so far as they
are bondholders, or in so far as they can influence bondholders
by argument do their opinions carry weight. President Ives of the
Northern Pacific in 1893 was able to use his position to fight his
opponents through the courts, and secured besides appointment on a
stockholders’ protective committee, but exercised no great influence
on the reorganization; President Jewett, of the Erie, gained the
confidence of the visiting committee of English bondholders in 1875,
and had some voice accorded him; but generally speaking officers
have to rest content if they can successfully defend themselves
against charges of inefficiency and mismanagement. They are, in
fact, both the choice and the representatives of the stockholders,
and the stockholders having no authority in the event of bankruptcy
can delegate none. Officers of the courts which are in control
of bankrupt railroads enjoy sometimes a different position from
officers of the corporations themselves, in that they do not
represent or depend on stockholders, and may not be connected with
the circumstances which have caused the ruin of the road. Thus
the receivers of the Union Pacific in the nineties were called to
testify before Congressional committees, and those of the Erie chose
a committee which prepared the first reorganization plan suggested,
but in both cases the functions of the court officers were purely
advisory, and so they must always be.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_693" href="#FNanchor_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> In 1895 the final Atchison reorganization plan
announced the following arrangement: “A contract has been made with
a syndicate to furnish an amount of money equal to the assessments
of non-assenting or defaulting stockholders, and such syndicate, by
such payment, shall take the place of the non-assenting or defaulting
stockholders, and shall be entitled to receive the new common and
preferred stock, which non-assenting or defaulting stockholders
would have been entitled to receive if they had deposited their
stock and paid their assessment in full. Syndicates may also be
formed to furnish the money needed, in case of foreclosure, to pay
the non-assenting bondholders their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro rata</i> share of the proceeds
of sale, and to advance any cash which may be required during the
reorganization and for other purposes.” Chron. 60:658–62, 1895. The
reorganization plan of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in 1898 contained the
following: “A syndicate has been formed ... which agrees: 1st, To
purchase $6,975,000 of the new preferred stock, and $30,250,000 of
the new common stock, and to offer the same for sale to depositing
holders of old 1st and 2d preferred and common stock of the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio Railroad Company.... 2d, To purchase $9,000,000 3½ per
cent prior lien bonds; $12,450,000 1st mortgage 4 per cent bonds;
$16,450,000 preferred stock. 3d, To protect the new company in the
ownership and possession of the properties covered by $49,974,098 ...
of the existing mortgage bonds of the old company of different issues
by agreeing to purchase from the new company the new securities
not taken, but to which the holders of such bonds would have been
entitled if depositing under the plan, at a price equal to the
principal of the respective old securities, and also to make advances
and perform other obligations essential for the purposes of the
plan.” Poor’s Manual, 1898, p. 1381. Similar provisions appear in the
plans of the Erie, the Northern Pacific, the Reading, the Southern,
and the Union Pacific.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_699" href="#FNanchor_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> The assessments before 1893 were as follows: The
Erie levied 2½ per cent on its common and preferred in 1859, and a
minimum of $4 on its common and $2 on its preferred in 1877, with
no allowance of new securities in either case. The East Tennessee
assessed its common stock 6 per cent and its income mortgage 5 per
cent in 1886, and gave to the one a corresponding amount of 2d
preferred, and to the other of 1st preferred stock. The Reading
assessments in 1886 ranged from 2½ per cent on the deferred incomes
to 15 per cent on certain junior securities, with an assessment of
$10 on both classes of stock. Preferred stock was given for all
assessments up to the full amount of the sums taken.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_700" href="#FNanchor_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> The quotations six months after reorganization are
for the combined securities given in exchange for the old preferred
stock. In the case of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio <i>e. g.</i>, this was 150 per
cent in new common; for the Northern Pacific it was 50 per cent new
common and 50 per cent new preferred. Only $5,000,000 of Baltimore
&amp; Ohio preferred stock were outstanding before the reorganization
of 1898, and no record of quotations can be found. Quotations are
similarly unobtainable for the Reading in 1886.</p></div>

$9,122,257 on bonds.</p></div>

Reading fixed charges after reorganization, eliminating duplications.
In computing the percentage of charges to earnings in 1898, however,
the unrefined figure of $12,210,291 is used in connection with a
similarly unrefined figure of earnings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_710" href="#FNanchor_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> The reorganizations omitted are those of the Union
Pacific in 1880, which did not alter fixed charges, and of the Erie
in 1859 and the Northern Pacific in 1875, for which precise figures
are not available. In this last charges were almost entirely removed;
its exclusion, therefore, tends to lessen the percentage of reduction
shown for the reorganizations before 1893.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_711" href="#FNanchor_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> The six reorganizations before 1893 include that of
the Atchison in 1892, which was not caused by inability to earn
charges, and consequently made no attempt to lower their figure.
Excluding this reorganization, the reductions in charges before
1893 overbalanced the increases. H. V. Poor calculates the absolute
reduction in fixed charges for sixty-eight railroads reorganized
between 1885 and 1897 at $24,007,490. (Manual, 1900, p. cvi.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_712" href="#FNanchor_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> The decrease in charges per mile for the Reading in
1880 was due, not to any reduction in charges, but to an increase in
mileage through the lease of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. In
this case the increase in absolute charges better represents the real
effect of the reorganization.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_713" href="#FNanchor_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> It is perhaps unnecessary to warn the reader that
these tables can be taken as generally indicative only. The
percentage of charges to earnings varies not only with charges
but with earnings; and an increase or decrease in the latter may
conceal a decidedly contrary movement in the former. Since the
reorganizations were accomplished at different dates the error is not
in all cases in the same direction, and in particular the percentage
of charges to earnings for one road cannot be compared with the
percentage for another. The figures of charges per mile of line are
somewhat more reliable, but are nevertheless to be used with care.
Different railroads report their mileage differently, and it has not
been possible in all cases to use the homogeneous figure of mileage
operated. Further, the significance of high charges per mile varies
with the character of the mileage. A reorganization which lops off
many unprofitable branch lines may conceivably cause thereby an
increase in the charges per mile of road remaining, and yet place
the system in a much stronger position than before. This difficulty
disappears if the figure of charges per mile be used in connection
with the percentage of charges to earnings, and in general the three
columns given correct each other.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_717" href="#FNanchor_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> The figure for the Reading in 1880 is affected by the
lease of the Central of New Jersey, which took place simultaneously
with the reorganization. Excluding the increase in rentals, the
remaining increase in fixed charges amounted to only 9.5 per cent.
The East Tennessee reported no rentals in either 1885 or in 1887.
The data for the Southern Railway are not in such shape that rentals
and interest can be compared. Its reorganization reduced rentals,
however, very greatly.</p></div>

these tables consist partly in the absence of quotations for certain
classes of bonds, and partly in the lack of sufficiently detailed and
precise information in some of the early reorganization plans. Thus
there are no quotations recorded in 1874–5 for the 2d consols and
convertible bonds of the Erie Railroad which were disturbed by the
subsequent reorganization; and no detailed figures of the exchange of
new bonds for old appear in the reports of the reorganization plans
of the Reading in 1881–3, and of the Northern Pacific in 1875. The
reorganization of the Union Pacific and of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp;
Pacific in 1880 did not disturb the bonds outstanding.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
